      <abstract>
        <p>Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) has been shown to be caused by germline mutations in the gene <italic>CDH1</italic> located at 16q22.1, which encodes the cell&#x2013;cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin. Not only does loss of expression of E-cadherin account for the morphologic differences between intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) variants, but it also appears to lead to distinct cellular features which appear to be common amongst related cancers that have been seen in the syndrome. As in most hereditary cancer syndromes, multiple organ sites may be commonly affected by cancer, in HDGC, lobular carcinoma of the breast (LBC) and possibly other organ sites have been shown to be associated with the familial cancer syndrome. Given the complexity of HDGC, not only with regard to the management of the DGC risk, but also with regard to the risk for other related cancers, such as LBC, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed for the management of individuals with known <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite an overall decrease in the global incidence of gastric cancer (GC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the incidence of the subtype, diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) has remained stable and may even be increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Within the past ten years, germline mutations in <italic>CDH1</italic>, which encodes E-cadherin, have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] in over 50% of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) families with at least two cases of GC, with one diagnosed as DGC before the age of 50&#xA0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Within these HDGC families, we and others have noted an overrepresentation of lobular breast cancer (LBC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This observation has led to efforts to determine whether or not <italic>CDH1</italic> is a breast cancer susceptibility gene, distinct from its gastric cancer risk. Recently our group has reported a novel germline <italic>CDH1</italic> truncating mutation (517insA) in an LBC family with no known history of GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Within this review we report a germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation in a second family in which breast cancer is the predominant cancer diagnosis. The management of HDGC in all patients with a particular focus on the management of the breast cancer risk associated with germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations will be discussed.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>The described family was referred to the ongoing HDGC study at the British Columbia Cancer Agency from a cancer genetics clinic in Seattle, WA, USA. Informed consent was obtained from the proband by the referring genetic counselor following ascertainment of a detailed cancer family history and appropriate genetic counseling prior to germline mutation testing. Our laboratory carried out the molecular genetic testing for the <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation on a research basis. Approval for the HDGC study is by the clinical research ethics board of the University of British Columbia.</p>
      <p>The proband (IV-4) was diagnosed with widely metastatic lobular breast cancer at age 53&#xA0;years (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Her family, of European ancestry, had a history of breast cancer diagnoses occurring in an autosomal dominant fashion on the maternal side of the family where her mother, aunt, and first cousin developed breast cancer in their 50&#x2019;s. Due to her high-risk pedigree <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, and <italic>PTEN</italic> genetic testing was undertaken and all were negative. <italic>CDH1</italic> testing was also pursued.

      <p>All 16 exons were amplified for DHPLC analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For exon 10 of <italic>CDH1</italic>, the initial amplicon failed and was therefore analyzed by direct sequencing and thus revealed a donor splice site mutation, 1565&#xA0;+&#xA0;1G&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;A (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Due to its position at a donor splice site, this mutation is regarded as pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>The proband&#x2019;s sisters (IV-2 and IV-6) participated in all aspects of the proband&#x2019;s genetic consultation. They were appropriately concerned about their risk of breast cancer, but had not thought much about the possibility of getting gastric cancer until the <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation was found. IV-2 and IV-6 had predictive genetic testing for the <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation testing and both were found to be negative. Other family members are being informed about the availability of predictive genetic testing.</p>

        <title>E-cadherin</title>
        <p><italic>CDH1</italic> (OMIM *192090), located on chromosome 16q22.1 encodes, E-cadherin, an epithelial transmembrane cell&#x2013;cell adhesion molecule and member of the cadherin superfamily of glycoproteins. In a zipper-like fashion, its extracellular domain forms calcium-dependent homodimers between the E-cadherin molecules of adjacent epithelial cells, to act as the primary mediator of epithelial cell adhesion at the adherens junction complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Through interactions of its cytoplasmic tail with multiple signalling and structural molecules, such as the catenins, E-cadherin, maintains cellular adhesion and epithelial architecture with this link to the cytoskeleton. The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin directly associates with &#x3B2;-catenin and &#x3B3;-catenin which in turn binds to the f-actin microfilaments of the cytoskeleton, directly or through &#x3B1;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. p120-catenin also associates with E-cadherin&#x2019;s cytoplasmic tail at a different site, the juxtamembrane domain, and acts to both strengthen the adhesion between cells and regulate cadherin membrane trafficking and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. E-cadherin is considered to have an invasion suppressor role, where decreased expression permits cells to dissociate from each other in order to migrate and invade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In cancers, this manifests as increased infiltrative and metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. E-cadherin is also thought to act as a tumour suppressor, potentially through its interaction with the multipurpose &#x3B2; -catenin molecule which is an effector of the WNT signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Loss of E-cadherin can result in &#x3B2;-catenin release from the membrane and translocation to the nucleus where it complexes with Tcf/Lef-1 transcription factors to initiate transcription of WNT responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Activation of these genes have been implicated in tumourigenesis through the WNT signalling pathway as seen in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In support of the role of E-cadherin as a tumour suppressor is the observation of abnormal or absent E-cadherin expression in precursor lesions of DGC and LBC, where the phenomenon is seen in in&#xA0;situ signet ring cell carcinomas found in prophylactic gastrectomy specimens from germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and the lobular carcinoma in&#xA0;situ lesions seen adjacent to invasive lobular breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These examples suggest that loss of E-cadherin is an early or even tumour-initiating event, however the actual molecular basis of such a potential role of E-cadherin in such cases is unknown.</p>
        <p>Inactivating <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations are found in 50% of sporadic DGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and cluster between exons seven and nine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in contrast with the low percentage of mutations seen in sporadic intestinal type GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Decreased expression of E-cadherin in DGCs may account for morphologic differences between intestinal and DGC variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Unlike somatic <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations, germline mutations associated with DGC are distributed throughout the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the cancers from individuals with <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations, <italic>CDH1</italic> acts as a classic tumour suppressor gene with loss of expression of the wildtype allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In a single study of 6 hereditary DGC cancers, inactivation of the wild-type allele could be attributed to promoter hypermethylation in 5 (83%) of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This finding warrants verification in a larger cohort as abnormal promoter methylation in early cancers could potentially form the basis of a screening test.

        <title>Lobular breast cancer and diffuse gastric cancer: loss of E-cadherin</title>
        <p>Currently germline mutations in single genes account for approximately 5&#x2013;10% of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. High penetrance genes such as <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> account for 3&#x2013;8%, and <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> as seen in Li-Fraumeni and Cowden syndrome together only account for &lt;0.1% of breast cancer diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Other medium and low penetrance genes such as <italic>CHK2</italic>, <italic>BRIP1</italic>, <italic>PALB2</italic> and <italic>ATM</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] have been identified, however, there still remains a proportion of hereditary breast cancer not yet determined. LBC accounts for approximately 10% of all breast cancers compared to the other major histologic subtype, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Several factors suggest that LBC has a stronger hereditary basis relative to IDC, such as the higher frequency of bilateral disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and also where excess familiality of LBC has been observed in population studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. LBCs compose only 3% and 9% of the breast cancer tumour types seen in germline BRCA 1 and 2 mutation carriers, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], illustrating that the genetic risk factors for the majority of cases are unaccounted for by these genes.</p>
        <p>The histology of LBC is characterized by infiltrative cancer cells which are isolated, highly dispersive and demonstrate a growth pattern with scattered and single files of tumor cells dispersed in stromal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This pathologic appearance is remarkably similar to DGCs and both LBC and DGC demonstrate characteristic mucinous, signet ring cells. This is not unexpected as E-cadherin staining is absent in 85% of sporadic invasive LBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and somatic <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations have been identified in 56% of sporadic LBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, in IDC, somatic <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations are not found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and complete loss of E-cadherin expression is an uncommon feature. As loss of E-cadherin expression is a distinctive trait of both LBCs and DGCs, it likely contributes to the unique histopathologic features shared by the two cancers.</p>
        <p>There are some differences with regard to the nature of the mutations seen in LBC and DGC. Generally mutations associated with sporadic LBC have been found to be nonsense or frameshift mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] which encode truncated, non-functional proteins, whereas in sporadic DGC, mutations have generally been found to be splice site and in-frame mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In sporadic LBC, mutations in <italic>CDH1</italic> are spread throughout the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] compared with the mutations seen in sporadic DGC which tend to cluster. Germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations associated with DGC and/or LBC occur throughout the gene (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, when the DGC and LBC associated <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations are tabulated and compared based on their 3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032; positions relative to the halfway point of the <italic>CDH1</italic> coding sequence (1324 or the start of exon 10), LBC associated mutations show a statistically significant trend towards clustering at the 3&#x2032; end (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, two-tailed <italic>P</italic>-value equals 0.0467) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As this association is of weak statistical significance, it is unlikely to impact clinical testing strategies. Future analyses of novel germline LBC<italic>-</italic>associated <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations should help to confirm this observation. Another difference between the molecular genetics of the two types of cancers, is that in sporadic LBC, silencing of E-cadherin expression is generally accomplished by a mutation in one allele in combination with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or promoter hypermethylation in the remaining allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This is in contrast to sporadic DGC, where biallellic inactivation is achieved by mutations in one allele in concert with promoter hypermethylation in the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>We have recently identified a truncating germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation in an LBC family where analysis of the tumour was suggestive of partial LOH in the WT allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our current case demonstrates a germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation (1565&#xA0;+&#xA0;1G&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;A) in a predominantly breast cancer family, which is predicted to disrupt splicing. The mutation is in the same conserved position as a previously reported mutation (1565&#xA0;+&#xA0;1G&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;T) which was found in an Arabian HDGC family with no recorded history of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Moreover, a previous study reported a germline missense mutation in a proband with LBC but did not detail family history, or functionally characterize the missense mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These examples demonstrate the need for further studies of germline mutations in LBC families in order to determine the mutation frequency and potential genotype-phenotype correlations.</p>

        <title>Lobular breast cancer and HDGC</title>
        <p>Breast cancer has been observed in HDGC kindreds to the extent where clustering of LBCs within HDGC families has led to the misclassification of families as breast cancer kindreds who test negative for <italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 1998, Keller described the first case of histologically defined LBC in association with HDGC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since then, several more HDGC families with associated breast cancer were reported where it was observed, that these cases were LBCs when pathology was available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
        <p>Prior to establishment of the association between HDGC and LBC, several efforts to determine whether <italic>CDH1</italic> was a breast cancer susceptibility gene were attempted in view of the well-recognised phenotype of loss of E-cadherin expression displayed by the breast cancer subtype. For various reasons these studies failed to demonstrate the link. Rahman et&#xA0;al. examined 65 cases of lobular carcinoma in&#xA0;situ, however did not pre-screen the cases based on family history and included a wide age range, from 26 to 71&#xA0;years, not necessarily in keeping with the usual age of onset seen in hereditary cancer syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Salashor examined 19 breast cancer tumours exhibiting LOH at the <italic>CDH1</italic> locus, however of those, only 3 were confirmed to be pure LBC or mixed LBC/IDC pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Lei examined 13 familial LBC cases and found no mutations, however did not define the extent of the family history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
        <p>Penetrance data based on 11 HDGC families, estimated the cumulative risk for LBC for female mutation carriers to be 39% (95% CI, 12&#x2013;84%) by 80&#xA0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. More recently we have published an estimated cumulative risk for breast cancer for females by the age of 75&#xA0;years as being 52% (95% CI, 29&#x2013;94%) from analysis of 4 predominantly gastric cancer pedigrees from Newfoundland with the 2398delC <italic>CDH1</italic> founder mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is with the caveat that LBC risk for <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation carriers has been assessed within high risk HDGC families, leading to a potential ascertainment bias and underestimation of the role of <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations in LBC development. To accommodate for this we have begun analysis of <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations within familial lobular breast cancer families or those families ascertained through a relatively young index case with confirmed LBC and have found germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations in these kindreds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

        <title>Clinical implications of <italic>CDH1</italic> associated LBC risk</title>
        <p>At this time, it seems reasonable to conclude that at least four groups of women are at increased risk for LBC: women with LBC and a family history of breast cancer, women with a known <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation, women from families with diffuse gastric cancer in whom no <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation has yet been identified; and women with a germline <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation. Since there has not yet been a large population based study of the prevalence of <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations among women with lobular breast cancer, it is premature to recommend genetic evaluation to women with a family history of breast cancer unless, at the very least, one of the breast cancers can be shown to have been lobular. Additional research can be expected to provide better guidance for these families.</p>
        <p>Although there are not yet definitive data available on surveillance or risk reduction programs for women with known <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations or untested women from <italic>CDH1</italic>-positive families, the high lifetime risk of LBC (39&#x2013;52%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] that these women face mandates their careful management. We suggest that they follow the recommendations for other high-risk women with hereditary breast cancer predisposition. This subgroup should be advised to practice breast self-examination; and to have annual mammograms, and semiannual clinical breast examination, beginning at least by age 30. There is certainly interest in regular bilateral breast MRI, as lobular breast cancer are known to frequently elude mammographic detection because they do not form masses or develop calcifications. These women can also be counseled to consider hormonal chemoprevention, since most LBCs are estrogen receptor positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and both tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce the risk of estrogen receptor positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] breast cancers in randomized trials. In addition, the risk reduction was greatest with both agents in women with lobular carcinoma in&#xA0;situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>
        <p>Prophylactic mastectomy may also be considered an option by some <italic>CDH1</italic>-positive women, particularly those who have been previously diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast or those who have had to undergo multiple biopsies for abnormal clinical findings. Several studies have reported a 90% reduction in breast cancer incidence with prophylactic mastectomy among women with a strong family history or with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The published series include some lobular breast cancers, but not at numbers sufficient to permit meaningful subset analysis at this time.</p>

        <title>Management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer</title>
        <p>Penetrance studies examining data from HDGC families, have estimated the lifetime risk of developing gastric cancer by age 75 and 80 respectively, to be from 40&#x2013;67% in men, to 63&#x2013;83% in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Although identification of germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations has enabled a significant proportion of HDGC families to utilise predictive testing to determine their individual risks of GC within <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation positive pedigrees, unfortunately screening for DGC is ineffective and the current recommendation is for consideration of prophylactic gastrectomy in mutation positive individuals. Positron emission tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and chromoendoscopic-directed biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] have been proposed over basic endoscopy as more sensitive means of screening carriers, however screening methods have been consistently undermined by the recurrent discovery of multifocal DGC lesions underlying normal mucosa in prophylactic gastrectomy specimens of individuals with recent negative screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Regardless of the current limitations of screening, it is currently recommended that consideration for genetic testing and screening begin in at risk individuals in the late teens or early twenties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and that prophylactic total gastrectomy be considered in the early twenties for mutation carriers. Female mutation carriers will need specialized counseling to the potential nutritional effects on pregnancy following gastrectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Further studies are currently underway to examine the quality of life impact of prophylactic gastrectomies. In the case report herein, although there was a GC in the maternal grandfather, the family history was more striking for the large number of breast cancer cases. This highlights the particular challenges we currently face with regard to counseling these families which appear to be mainly breast cancer, as it is unknown if the penetrance of DGC in this family is as high as it is in other HDGC pedigrees.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>HDGC is one of a number of hereditary cancer syndromes that feature both an increased breast and gastric cancer risk (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In general, a lack of shared genetic risks for most breast and GI cancers was suggested through a recent study of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11 colon cancer cell lines in which the only commonly mutated gene between these two cancer types is <italic>p53</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This likely reflects underlying differences in the biology of these diseases, however also highlights the unique nature of germline mutations in the <italic>CDH1</italic> gene which are strongly associated with specific histologically defined subtypes of breast and GI cancer, namely LBC and DGC which are both part of the HDGC syndrome.

      <p>With the recent demonstration of a <italic>CDH1</italic> mutation in a family ascertained through an index case of LBC and in view of the additional new mutation in a predominantly breast cancer family that we have described here, the evidence for establishing LBC as part of the HDGC syndrome is strong. There now is a need for establishing the prevalence of <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations in LBC families to avoid the ascertainment bias generated from only looking at cases from families identified because of their family history of GC. It is not currently known what the risk of GC is in these families which present predominantly as having a susceptibility to breast cancer and therefore identification of <italic>CDH1</italic> as a true susceptibility gene for LBC could result in <italic>CDH1</italic> screening and effective risk reduction strategies for selected breast cancer families and further studies examining their risk for gastric and other cancers.</p>
      <p>Most hereditary cancer syndromes are associated with cancer risk involving multiple organs. Here we have discussed germline <italic>CDH1</italic> mutations and the risks with regard to DGC and LBC, however as the recognised spectrum of related cancers broadens, more affected families will be identified and successfully managed with regard to avoidance of specific cancer risks. Longer life expectancy in individuals with penetrant mutations could potentially lead to the development of different, later onset disease as yet to be identified in these kindreds. This represents a particular challenge in hereditary cancer practice as the clinical community tends to be segregated into organ specific specialties where as the cancer risks and the risk reduction strategies for germline mutation carriers require a variety of expertise. The medical needs of the HDGC families are therefore best served through an engaged multidisciplinary team.</p>
