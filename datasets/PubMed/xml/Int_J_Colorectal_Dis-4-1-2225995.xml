          <p>Patients with moderate-to-severe active Crohn&#x2019;s disease (<italic>n&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>292) received subcutaneous certolizumab pegol 100, 200, or 400&#xA0;mg or placebo at weeks&#xA0;0, 4, and 8. A post hoc analysis of the intent-to-treat population (290 patients with HRQoL data) assessed HRQoL by evaluating patients&#x2019; responses to the self-administered inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) at baseline and weeks&#xA0;2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Patients receiving certolizumab pegol 400&#xA0;mg at weeks&#xA0;0, 4, and 8 demonstrated, via their IBDQ total score, significantly (<italic>P&#x2009;</italic>&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05) greater improvement in HRQoL from baseline to week&#xA0;12 and at all other time points compared with placebo. Moreover, HRQoL improved over time in all certolizumab pegol groups, irrespective of baseline C-reactive protein levels. Emotional well-being (IBDQ Emotional Function domain) improved throughout the study for patients receiving certolizumab pegol 400&#xA0;mg. This improvement was significantly (<italic>P&#x2009;</italic>&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05) greater than for patients receiving placebo at all time points. In addition, systemic symptoms (IBDQ Systemic Symptoms domain) improved significantly more in patients receiving certolizumab pegol 400&#xA0;mg than in those receiving placebo at weeks 4, 8, 10, and 12 (<italic>P&#x2009;</italic>&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05) and approached statistical significance at week 2 (<italic>P&#x2009;=&#x2009;</italic>0.054).</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Crohn&#x2019;s disease is a chronic relapsing and remitting, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that has a significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HRQoL has been recognized as an important health outcome and has been defined in the medical setting as &#x201C;a concept encompassing a broad range of physical and psychological characteristics and limitations which describe an individual&#x2019;s ability to function and derive satisfaction from doing so&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Crohn&#x2019;s disease frequently begins in early adulthood, causing a heavy disease burden in a relatively young patient population. Consequently, many patients will be affected for most of their adult life.</p>
      <p>In Crohn&#x2019;s disease, health status is affected as much by psychosocial factors and functional status as by disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, the need to wear an ostomy bag may adversely affect self-image, and this has been reported to be a common worry for patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated a high correlation between disease severity, as measured by the Crohn&#x2019;s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and HRQoL, as assessed using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A large longitudinal study prospectively assessed the HRQoL of patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease over 1&#xA0;year and determined influencing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The following factors were associated with a negative impact on overall HRQoL: female gender, tobacco use, active Crohn&#x2019;s disease, involvement of the colon, hospitalization, corticosteroid treatment, and surgery in the past 3&#xA0;months (order does not indicate priority). These findings were reflected in a survey of patients with a long-term diagnosis of Crohn&#x2019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is therefore important to include improvement in HRQoL as a key therapeutic goal in the treatment of patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease.</p>
      <p>Conventional treatment options for Crohn&#x2019;s disease include aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and surgery. However, in some patients, the disease can be refractory or unresponsive to certain pharmacologic treatments. Furthermore, corticosteroids are associated with a risk of dependency and potentially serious side effects (e.g., diabetes, osteoporosis, moon face, and acne), which are detrimental to a patient&#x2019;s HRQoL and may negatively affect self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Such treatments therefore require careful management. Additionally, it is rarely possible to achieve long-term relief from Crohn&#x2019;s disease with a single surgical procedure, and as a result, patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease fear surgery so much that their HRQoL is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is now well accepted that tumor necrosis factor &#x3B1; (TNF&#x3B1;) plays a pivotal role in the underlying inflammatory pathophysiology of Crohn&#x2019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, neutralization of TNF&#x3B1; has been shown to improve the symptoms of this debilitating illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Infliximab has been shown to improve HRQoL, as measured by the IBDQ and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but the occurrence of infusion reactions along with the risk of developing anti-infliximab antibodies, which can reduce long-term efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], could negatively impact HRQoL over time. Patients may feel that subcutaneous treatment has advantages over treatments requiring infusion; a long stay at the clinic may negatively impact a patient&#x2019;s daily life. This increased freedom in patient treatment management may lead to improved treatment compliance with a consequent impact on therapeutic outcomes. Thus, there is a need for alternative long-term therapies for moderate-to-severe Crohn&#x2019;s disease that have minimal negative impact on patients&#x2019; everyday life while also reducing the impact of the disease on patients&#x2019; HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>Certolizumab pegol is the first polyethylene glycolated (PEGylated) anti-TNF&#x3B1; antibody fragment (Fab&#x2019;) to be studied in Crohn&#x2019;s disease. Unlike conventional anti-TNF agents, certolizumab pegol lacks the crystallizable fragment (Fc) region, thus potentially avoiding unwanted effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. PEGylation increases the plasma half-life and reduces the frequency of dosing required. Certolizumab pegol is administered by subcutaneous injection once every 4&#xA0;weeks (more frequent dosing may be used during an induction phase). Certolizumab pegol 400&#xA0;mg administered subcutaneously demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated in patients with moderate-to-severe active Crohn&#x2019;s disease in phases II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and III (PRECiSE 1 and PRECiSE 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) studies. Certolizumab pegol has also demonstrated clinical efficacy and good tolerability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>This is the first paper to report the effect of certolizumab pegol, a monthly subcutaneous treatment, on the HRQoL of patients with moderate-to-severe active Crohn&#x2019;s disease in a phase II placebo-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. HRQoL was assessed using the IBDQ.</p>

        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study conducted at 58 international centers between February 2001 and March 2002. An 8-week follow-up period allowed collection of additional safety data. At screening, patients with moderate-to-severe active Crohn&#x2019;s disease were stratified according to concomitant steroids, immunosuppressants, or long-term anti-infectives. Eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive certolizumab pegol (100, 200, or 400&#xA0;mg) or placebo (0.9% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic> saline) by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 4, and 8 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Before dosing, patients&#x2019; demography, medical history, and concomitant diseases were recorded.

        <title>Outcomes</title>
        <p>The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients achieving a clinical response [&#x2265;100-point decrease in CDAI score or CDAI score &#x2264;150 points (remission)] at week 12. HRQoL was a secondary endpoint evaluated at baseline (week&#xA0;0, pre-injection) and at weeks&#xA0;2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 using the 32-item self-administered IBDQ. The IBDQ is a disease-specific HRQoL measure. The questionnaire assesses the four aspects of a patient&#x2019;s life that are affected by IBD: symptoms directly related to the primary bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional function, and social function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the IBDQ have been demonstrated by Guyatt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Irvine et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The IBDQ is completed using a 7-point Likert response for each question. Total IBDQ scores range from 32 to 224, with a higher score indicating better HRQoL. Remission is generally indicated by a score of at least 170 points, and a change of 16 points is regarded as clinically meaningful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to a total score, domain scores can be calculated for the Bowel Symptoms, Systemic Symptoms, Emotional Function, and Social Function domains. IBDQ measurements were performed in parallel with determination of CDAI score and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP). Official IBDQ versions translated into Danish, French, German, and Swedish were used. Our own translations were used for Russian, Serbian, and Afrikaans. To assess whether our own translated versions of the IBDQ provided a valid measure of HRQoL, we compared scores of the translated versions with those of the official translated versions and evaluated those scores in relation to the patient&#x2019;s CDAI scores. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to check for influence of specific item scores on the resulting total scores. The results of these analyses demonstrated that our own translated versions of the IBDQ provided a valid measure of HRQoL, comparable to the official, translated versions.</p>

      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>A sample size of 260 patients was calculated to give approximately 83% power to detect a true difference between treatment groups of 23% for the primary endpoint of the study, based on a placebo response rate of 12%. After screening, patients were to be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (65 patients to each of the four treatment groups). Therefore, 195 patients were to receive certolizumab pegol and 65 were to receive placebo.</p>
        <p>Efficacy was assessed for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all patients who received at least one injection and had at least one efficacy measurement after the first injection. Patients who terminated the trial prematurely were advanced to the end-of-study visit. The last observation carried forward method was used in cases where data were missing.</p>
        <p>Post hoc analyses of IBDQ total score and individual domain scores were performed. These were purely exploratory in nature. Relationships between CDAI and IBDQ global scores at week&#xA0;12 were assessed for the ITT population using Kendall&#x2019;s tau coefficient, a measure of the strength of dependence showing to what extent these two variables move in the same direction. Changes from baseline in IBDQ total score and individual domain scores for each treatment group were formally compared with the placebo group. Least-squares means, adjusted for stratum, pooled country, and baseline IBDQ score, were compared across treatment groups. Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was used to compare the proportion of patients who achieved remission (defined as an IBDQ total score of &#x2265;170 points) in each active treatment group with that for the placebo group at each week. The analyses were performed based on both the overall ITT population and in the subgroup of patients with elevated baseline CRP (&#x2265;10&#xA0;mg/l). <italic>P</italic> values &#x2264;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p>

      <p>The clinical efficacy and safety assessments of this phase II dose-finding study have been reported in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Because the 400&#xA0;mg dose was identified as being the most appropriate dose, this paper focuses on data for patients receiving certolizumab pegol 400&#xA0;mg.</p>
      <sec id="Sec9">
        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>In total, 372 patients were screened of whom 292 patients were enrolled (CDAI score &lt;220 points was the most common reason for screening failure). Of these 292 patients, 291 were included in the ITT population used to measure the efficacy endpoints according to CDAI scores [1 patient (400&#xA0;mg group) was excluded because of missing efficacy data]. Baseline IBDQ scores were not obtained for one patient in the certolizumab pegol 100&#xA0;mg treatment group. The ITT analyses for the HRQoL evaluations therefore included data for 290 patients. Seventy-five patients (25.7%) withdrew from the study by week&#xA0;12. The majority of withdrawals were a consequence of lack of improvement/disease progression.</p>
        <p>Baseline CRP measurements were obtained for 290 of the 291 patients in the ITT population. Elevated baseline CRP levels (&#x2265;10&#xA0;mg/l) were recorded for 119 patients (41.0%). One of these patients was the patient in the certolizumab pegol 100&#xA0;mg treatment group who was excluded from analyses as a result of baseline IBDQ scores not being obtained. The subgroup analyses of IBDQ by baseline CRP status were therefore performed on data from 118 patients with an elevated baseline CRP concentration.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease often have poor HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], with disease-related concerns, such as worry about needing surgery, being the main causal factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It therefore follows that treatments relieving the symptoms of Crohn&#x2019;s disease and/or reducing the risk of surgery should improve HRQoL in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease.</p>
      <p>Certolizumab pegol administered subcutaneously every 4&#xA0;weeks is a rapid and clinically effective treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn&#x2019;s disease with the 400&#xA0;mg dose (highest dose tested) inducing the highest response rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This analysis indicates that such clinical findings are accompanied by improvements in HRQoL.</p>
      <p>Certolizumab pegol 400&#xA0;mg appears to exert a rapid, consistently positive effect on HRQoL in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn&#x2019;s disease. Patients who received certolizumab pegol 400&#xA0;mg demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvements in IBDQ total score than those in the placebo group as early as week 2 and at all subsequent time points. As a reflection of the lower baseline IBDQ scores in the 400&#xA0;mg group, patients in this group experienced the greatest improvement, despite the remission rate (which is the proportion of patients reaching a pre-defined score) being higher in the 100&#xA0;mg group. Improvements in HRQoL were not dependent on baseline CRP level. Higher baseline CRP concentration was associated with greater improvement in clinical variables in this phase II study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but such a relationship has not been evident in phase III studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, patients receiving certolizumab pegol 200&#xA0;mg showed a statistically significantly greater change from baseline in IBDQ total score than those receiving placebo at weeks&#xA0;2 and 4. Collectively, these findings suggest that certolizumab pegol has an early treatment effect in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn&#x2019;s disease. The benefits of certolizumab pegol on HRQoL were also apparent in the phase III studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>Improvements in emotional well-being (e.g. depression, anxiety, irritability, and anger resulting from bowel problems) and systemic symptom domains were particularly marked with certolizumab pegol treatment. It appears that the improvements in these two domains of the IBDQ are largely responsible for the reported beneficial effect of certolizumab pegol on HRQoL. Overall, these findings suggest that certolizumab pegol alleviates the psychological symptoms associated with Crohn&#x2019;s disease and improves a patient&#x2019;s general well-being, in addition to providing clinical benefits in terms of CDAI response.</p>
      <p>HRQoL provides an integral picture of the interactions between a patient&#x2019;s disease, their treatment, and quality of life&#x2014;positive effects resulting from the efficacy of a treatment and negative effects caused by adverse events are evaluated. Few trials have examined the effects of conventional agents upon HRQoL in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease. While corticosteroids are effective in controlling acute Crohn&#x2019;s disease and are reported to improve IBDQ scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the potentially serious adverse events associated with corticosteroids may negate any positive effects on HRQoL gained through control of symptoms. Additionally, corticosteroids are not suitable for maintenance treatment. Improvements in HRQoL have been observed with methotrexate treatment in a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, 17% of patients (16/94) receiving methotrexate were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients (1/47).</p>
      <p>The improvements in HRQoL observed with certolizumab pegol in this study appear to be similar to those reported in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease after treatment with infliximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Similarly, natalizumab has been shown to improve HRQoL in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>Given the detrimental effects of Crohn&#x2019;s disease on physical and psychosocial functioning, additional research is needed to assess the impact of currently available and newer therapies on HRQoL. Although HRQoL was evaluated using the self-administered IBDQ, which has proved to be a valid and reliable disease-specific instrument for determining health status in patients with Crohn&#x2019;s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the analyses presented in this paper were purely exploratory in nature, and firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the results described. However, clinical benefit was also accompanied by improved HRQoL in the phase III studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Further benefits may be gained through the good tolerability of certolizumab pegol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and convenience of subcutaneous dosing with certolizumab pegol once every 4&#xA0;weeks.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study demonstrates that the clinical efficacy of certolizumab pegol in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn&#x2019;s disease, which is evident within 2&#xA0;weeks of injection, is paralleled by improvements in HRQoL. The benefits of certolizumab pegol were most pronounced at the highest dose tested (400&#xA0;g). Improvements in emotional well-being and systemic symptoms appear to be largely responsible for the observed beneficial effect of certolizumab pegol on HRQoL.</p>
