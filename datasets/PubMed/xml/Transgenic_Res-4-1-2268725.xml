        <p>Mast cells are important effectors of type I allergy but also essential regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. The aim of this study was to develop a Cre recombinase-expressing mouse line that allows mast cell-specific inactivation of genes in&#xA0;vivo. Following a BAC transgenic approach, Cre was expressed under the control of the <italic>mast cell protease (Mcpt) 5</italic> promoter. <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> transgenic mice were crossed to the ROSA26-EYFP Cre excision reporter strain. Efficient Cre-mediated recombination was observed in mast cells from the peritoneal cavity and the skin while only minimal reporter gene expression was detected outside the mast cell compartment. Our results show that the <italic>Mcpt5</italic> promoter can drive Cre expression in a mast cell-specific fashion. We expect that our <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> mice will be a useful tool for the investigation of mast cell biology.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mast cells are central effector cells in type I allergy (Kawakami and Galli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>; Metcalfe et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>), but have recently been shown to be important initiators and effectors also of innate immunity as well as modulators of adaptive immune responses (Galli et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">b</xref>; Marshall and Jawdat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>). Many reports demonstrated a role of mast cells in host defence against pathogens (Dawicki and Marshall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>; Echtenacher et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1996</xref>; Malaviya et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>) and implicated a function of these cells in wound healing, tissue remodeling and transplant tolerance (Lu et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; Trautmann et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2000</xref>; Weller et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>). A pathogenic role of mast cells was discussed in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis (Bachelet et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Irani et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1992</xref>; Lee et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>; Secor et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2000</xref>; Sun et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Investigation of mast cell biology was severely hampered by the scarcity of these cells in tissues. Experimental systems that have widely been used are in&#xA0;vitro analysis of mast cell lines or mast cells differentiated in&#xA0;vitro from bone marrow (BMMC). In&#xA0;vivo analysis of the function of genes in mast cells until today relied on the reconstitution of mast cell-deficient rodents with mast cells derived from bone marrow or hematopoietic cells of gene-deficient animals or from gene-deficient embryonic stem cells (Kitamura et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1978</xref>; Nakano et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1985</xref>; Tsai et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000)</xref>. These systems yielded valuable information, but suffer important limitations. In the mouse lines <italic>kit</italic><sup><italic>W/W-v</italic></sup> and <italic>kit</italic><sup><italic>W-sh/W-sh</italic></sup>, which are commonly used for reconstitution experiments, spontaneous mutations of the <italic>kit</italic> gene coding region or its regulatory elements result in reduced activity of the kit receptor that controls development and survival of mast cells (Galli et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005b</xref>; Grimbaldeston et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>). In addition to mast cell-deficiency, <italic>kit</italic><sup><italic>W/W-v</italic></sup>animals are characterized by sterility, anemia, absence of melanocytes and interstitial cells of Cajal, a high incidence of dermatitis, papillomas of the forestomach, gastric ulcers and dilation of the duodenum (Galli et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005b</xref>). <italic>kit</italic><sup><italic>W-sh</italic></sup> animals, which lately are being used instead of <italic>kit</italic><sup><italic>W/W-v</italic></sup> mice, seem to feature a more narrow defect with deficiency for mast cells, melanocytes, and interstitial cells of Cajal (Grimbaldeston et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>). The transfer of <italic>in&#xA0;vitro</italic> cultivated mast cells into mast cell-deficient animals by intradermal, intraperitoneal or intravenous injections can result in mast cell numbers, which, dependent on the route of cell transfer and the anatomical site, can approach normal mast cell density, but often remain considerably lower with significant variability (Grimbaldeston et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>; Tsai et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> recombination system represents a powerful tool that allows for conditional, e.g. cell type-specific, inactivation of genes in the mouse (Rajewsky et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1996</xref>). Since the first description of in&#xA0;vivo mutagenesis using the Cre/<italic>loxP</italic> system (Gu et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1994</xref>), an impressive number of floxed mouse lines has been generated. Herein, we report the first <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic line allowing mast cell-specific gene inactivation in&#xA0;vivo.</p>

        <title>Construction of the transgene and generation of transgenic mice</title>
        <p>The construct was based on a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) encompassing the entire <italic>Mcpt5</italic> gene. The BAC clone RP23-284A14 from the mouse BAC library RPCI-23 (Osoegawa et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>) was obtained from RZPD (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum f&#xFC;r Genomforschung GmbH, Berlin, Germany). All modifications were done by homologous recombination in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Zhang et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1998</xref>) and sequences of all oligonucleotides used for construction by homologous recombination are listed in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Neighbouring genes contained in the BAC were excluded by replacing several kb of DNA at both ends of the insert by resistance genes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In a next step, a modified i<italic>Cre</italic> (<underline>i</underline>mproved Cre, Shimshek et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>) gene cassette (Testa et&#xA0;al. unpublished) was inserted into the <italic>Mcpt5</italic> gene. The <italic>Cre</italic> cassette was first assembled with a <italic>loxm2</italic>-flanked neomycin-resistance cassette (<italic>neo</italic>) and flanked by homology regions (HR) for recombination into the <italic>Mcpt5</italic> gene. This was done by subcloning the <italic>Cre</italic> cDNA into a minimal vector consisting of the origin of replication and a chloramphenicol resistance gene amplified from pACYC184 (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). The primers used for the amplification contain the HRs for both subcloning of <italic>Cre</italic> and insertion into the <italic>Mcpt5</italic> gene (see Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In a next step, the neomycin cassette was inserted 3&#x2032; of <italic>Cre</italic> and 5&#x2032; of the <italic>Mcpt5</italic> HR. The HR-<italic>Cre-Neo</italic>-HR cassette was released from the minimal vector by <italic>Not</italic>I digestion and recombined into the BAC replacing the coding part of exon 1 of the <italic>Mcpt5</italic> gene followed by Cre-mediated deletion of <italic>neo</italic>. The construct was purified for pronucleus injection as described by Sparwasser et&#xA0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>) with modifications. Briefly, the construct was separated from the BAC backbone by <italic>Not</italic>I digest and purified by gel electrophoresis and electroelution. Pronucleus injection was done by R. Naumann, MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany. Genotyping of <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> transgenic mice was performed by PCR (primers: Mcpt5-CreFor 5&#x2032;ACAGTGGTATTCCCGGGGAGTGT, Mcpt5-CreRev 5&#x2032; GTCAGTGCGTTCAAAGGCCA). Founder mice were bred to the ROSA26-EYFP reporter line (Srinivas et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>) and five to 15&#xA0;week old mice were analyzed for reporter gene expression. Animals were housed under SPF conditions and all experiments were done according to institutional guidelines.

        <title>Transgene construction and screening of transgenic mice for Cre expression</title>
        <p>In order to drive Cre expression in mast cells, we used a BAC clone containing the entire <italic>Mcpt5</italic> gene along with abundant upstream and downstream flanking DNA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Neighboring genes were excluded by shortening the BAC on both ends to avoid possible effects of altered gene dosage in the transgenic mice. In a next step, the coding part of the first exon of <italic>Mcpt5</italic> was replaced by the <italic>Cre</italic> cassette (see Methods and Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The construct was released from the BAC backbone by <italic>Not</italic>I digest (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and injected into the pronuclei of C57BL/6 oocytes. Six <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> transgenic founder animals were obtained and mated to a ROSA26 reporter line (Srinivas et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>) which expresses enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) under the control of the ubiquitous <italic>ROSA26</italic> promoter following Cre-mediated deletion of a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked stop element. <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic><italic>ROSA26</italic>-<italic>EYFP</italic> double transgenic animals were analyzed for EYFP expression in peritoneal and skin mast cells by FACS as described below (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Reporter gene expression was detected in mast cells from three of the six founder lines. One of these lines showed EYFP expression in only 80% of peritoneal mast cells and was not investigated further. Close to 100% of peritoneal mast cells were EYFP positive in two lines, which, because of autosomal inheritance of the transgene in one line and X-linked inheritance in the other, were called &#x201C;A-Mcpt5-Cre&#x201D; and &#x201C;X-Mcpt5-Cre&#x201D;, respectively.

        <title>Efficient and mast cell-specific Cre-mediated recombination in the lines A-Mcpt5-Cre and X-Mcpt5-Cre</title>
        <p>Highly efficient Cre-mediated activation of reporter gene expression was uniformly observed in peritoneal CD117<sup>+</sup>Fc&#x3B5;RI&#x3B1;<sup>+ </sup>mast cells of seven <italic>A-Mcpt5-Cre ROSA26-EYFP</italic> double transgenic animals (98.7&#x2013;99.6%, on average 99.1%, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In skin cell suspensions mast cells were detected in extremely low numbers, on average 0.32%. (Skin mast cells were defined as CD117<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells. A staining of Fc&#x3B5;RI&#x3B1; on skin mast cells was not reliable in our hands, likely due to loss of epitopes after enzymatic tissue digestion). In the five animals for which this mast cell population was investigated, the majority of the few CD117<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+ </sup>cells gated was EYFP positive (43/47, 54/64, 32/39, 23/27 and 77/88 gated events, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Given that the mast cell gate will inevitably collect also some non-mast cells upon analysis of high total cell numbers (40,000 events), the percentage of skin mast cells expressing EYFP is probably close to 100%. A similar efficiency of Cre-mediated activation of the reporter gene was observed in three male X-Mcpt5-Cre mice (not shown) whereas the two female animals analyzed showed EYFP fluorescence in only 61% and 32% of peritoneal mast cells consistent with random X-chromosome inactivation (not shown).</p>
        <p>In both lines, Cre-mediated activation of EYFP expression was specific for mast cells. In seven A-Mcpt5-Cre and three male X-Mcpt5-Cre animals we detected no or only minimal numbers (i.e. below 1%) of EYFP positive cells (below 3% in one A-Mcpt5-Cre animal) in hematopoietic populations other than mast cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) or in non-hematopoietic cells of the skin cell suspensions (primarily keratinocytes and fibroblasts, not shown). As a control, we used mice with germline deletion of the stop element of the ROSA26-EYFP Cre excision reporter demonstrating that all non-mast cell populations analysed for reporter expression in <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> mice can, in principle, express EYFP (not shown). In contrast to the seven A-Mcpt5-Cre mice (described above) showing mast cell-specific Cre-mediated recombination, one A-Mcpt5-Cre mouse displayed non-specific reporter gene expression in 15&#x2013;25% of all cell types analyzed including non-hematopoietic cells of the skin (not shown). This finding likely reflects accidental early activity of the transgenic <italic>Mcpt5</italic> promoter.

Macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, B cells and T cells were stained for F4/80, CD11c, Gr-1, Siglec-F, CD19 and CD3&#x3B5;, respectively. The respective populations were gated and displayed in histogram plots.

        <title>Absence of significant Cre-mediated genotoxicity in mast cells of Mcpt5-Cre animals</title>
        <p>In order to exclude a reduced proliferative potential of mast cells in <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> transgenic mice due to Cre-mediated genotoxic effects, we compared the percentage of mast cells in peritoneal lavage and the proliferation of peritoneal mast cells from <italic>Mcpt5-Cre ROSA26-EYFP</italic> double transgenic or wild-type mice in&#xA0;vitro. Cell suspensions obtained by peritoneal lavage contained similar numbers of mast cells in wild-type and double transgenic mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Total peritoneal lavage cells were cultured in the presence of stem cell factor. After 23&#xA0;days, these cultures contained 98% mast cells as judged by expression of CD117 and Fc&#x25B;RI&#x3B1; (not shown). By this time, absolute cell numbers had increased more than 200-fold in both cultures (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Importantly, the mast cells grown from the <italic>Mcpt5-Cre ROSA26-EYFP</italic> positive mouse uniformly expressed EYFP (not shown) ruling out an overgrowth of the culture by a (hypothetical) minor population of mast cells, which do not express Cre. These results show that <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> positive mast cells are not growth retarded and therefore do not seem to be significantly affected by Cre-mediated genotoxicity.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we describe a novel Cre transgenic mouse allowing mast cell-specific knock out of genes in&#xA0;vivo. We employed BAC transgene technology to express a <italic>Cre</italic> cassette under the control of the <italic>Mcpt5</italic> promoter. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mast cell-specific Cre-mediated recombination in the mouse.</p>
      <p>To date, important insights into functions of mast cells have been gained by reconstitution of mast cell-deficient mice with mast cells differentiated in&#xA0;vitro from gene deficient bone marrow or embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells (Galli et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005b</xref>; Grimbaldeston et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>; Kitamura et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1978</xref>; Tsai et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). While this model yielded important information, inherent technical problems limit experimentation and interpretation of data in this system (Tsai et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). We expect that mast cell-specific knock out of genes using our new <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic line will greatly facilitate investigation of mast cell biology.</p>
      <p>The two <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic lines demonstrate that the <italic>Mcpt5</italic>-promoter allows efficient and cell type-specific expression of a <italic>Cre</italic> transgene inserted into the first exon. One animal of the line A-Mcpt5-Cre (characterized by <underline>a</underline>utosomal transgene inheritance) showed non-specific Cre-mediated recombination in non-mast cells while seven animals of this line did not. This finding likely reflects accidental early activity of the transgenic <italic>Mcpt5</italic> promoter, e.g. in one stem cell during the embryonic four cell stage. Future analysis will define the frequency of such events more precisely. In females of the X-Mcpt5-Cre line (<underline>X</underline>-chromosomal inheritance), Cre-mediated recombination occurred in only about half of the mast cells due to inactivation of the transgene-carrying X-chromosome. Incomplete inactivation of particular genes may be advantageous if the attenuation of a severe phenotype is desired.</p>
      <p>Cre recombinase has been shown to mediate genotoxicity in some <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic or <italic>Cre</italic> knock in mouse strains resulting in a reduced proliferative potential or even death of Cre expressing cells (Schmidt-Supprian and Rajewsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). In <italic>Mcpt5-Cre</italic> mice, however, we found no difference in mast cell numbers or proliferation of mast cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> in response to stem cell factor indicating that Cre-mediated genome damage is not a prominent feature of these mice.</p>
      <p>We are currently refining our system further to achieve also inducible mast cell-specific gene inactivation in adult mice. In addition, we are breeding the new lines to iDTR mice (Buch et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>) aiming at diphtheria toxin-inducible ablation of the mast cell lineage in adult animals.</p>
