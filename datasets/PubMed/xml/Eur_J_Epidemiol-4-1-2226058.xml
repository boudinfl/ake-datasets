        <p><italic>Objective</italic> To investigate the relationship between the apolipoprotein E (<italic>APOE</italic>) gene and the risk of mortality in normal weight, overweight and obese individuals. <italic>Methods and Results</italic> In a population-based study of 7,983 individuals aged 55&#xA0;years and older, we compared the risks of all-cause and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality by <italic>APOE</italic> genotype, both overall and in subgroups defined by body mass index (BMI). We found significant evidence for interaction between APOE and BMI in relation to total cholesterol (<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.04) and HDL cholesterol (<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.001). Overall, <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers showed a decreased risk of all-cause mortality.

The effect of <italic>APOE*</italic>2 in normal weight individuals tended to be due to the risk of CHD mortality (adjusted HR 0.5 [95% CI 0.2&#x2013;1.2]). <italic>Conclusion</italic> The <italic>APOE*</italic>2 allele confers a lower risk of all-cause mortality only to normal weight individuals.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Apolipoprotein E is a plasma protein involved in the metabolism of cholesterol. The apolipoprotein E isoforms &#x3B5;2, &#x3B5;3 and &#x3B5;4, determined by the three alleles of the apolipoprotein E gene (<italic>APOE*</italic>2, <italic>APOE</italic>*3 and <italic>APOE*</italic>4), differ in their binding affinity to serum cholesterol and hence in their ability to clear dietary fat from the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Accordingly, total serum cholesterol levels differ between <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes, with <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers having lower total serum cholesterol levels and <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers having higher levels than <italic>APOE*</italic>3 homozygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
    <p>In line with the clear differences in total serum cholesterol levels associated with the <italic>APOE</italic> genotype, one would expect that <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers have lower risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers have higher risks. Yet, the evidence for this association is inconsistent. A recent meta-analysis showed that <italic>APOE*</italic>4 was associated with a higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but found no association with <italic>APOE*</italic>2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. <italic>APOE*</italic>2 has been associated with a lower risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and <italic>APOE*</italic>4 with a higher risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but also these relationships were not found by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
    <p>A possible explanation for these inconsistencies may be found in the role of body weight. Several studies have demonstrated that the relationship between the <italic>APOE</italic> gene and lipids differs between normal weight, overweight and obese individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Total serum cholesterol levels were higher among obese than among non-obese <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and obese <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers had higher serum triglycerides and higher LDL-cholesterol levels than non-obese <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers generally have the lowest cholesterol levels, those with high BMI were found to have similar total serum cholesterol levels compared to <italic>APOE*</italic>3 homozygotes and <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These findings suggest that the adverse effects of high body weight may outweigh the beneficial effect of <italic>APOE</italic>*2 status. If so, a protective effect of <italic>APOE</italic>*2 on mortality may be largest among normal weight individuals.</p>
    <p>Despite this evidence for a moderating effect of body weight on the relation between the <italic>APOE</italic> gene and total serum cholesterol, no studies so far have performed a stratified analysis on the relationship between the <italic>APOE</italic> gene and the risk of mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which the relationship between <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes and the risk of mortality differs between normal weight, overweight and obese individuals. We examined this relationship for both all-cause and CHD mortality.</p>

        <title>Study population and procedures</title>
        <p>The present analyses were performed in the Rotterdam Study, an ongoing population-based study on the determinants of disease and disability among persons 55&#xA0;years and older. Details of this study have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Baseline data were collected between 1990 and 1993. During home visits, a trained investigator obtained information on health status, medical history, medication use and lifestyle. Subsequently, participants were invited to the study center where they underwent an extensive clinical examination. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center approved the study protocol and all participants provided written informed consent. From 10,275 eligible subjects, 7,983 (78%) individuals agreed to participate in the study and were examined at baseline.</p>

          <title>Clinical and laboratory assessments</title>
          <p>The clinical examination included weight, height, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum glucose, total serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. BMI was computed as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Participants were classified as underweight (BMI&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;18.5&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal weight (18.5&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;BMI&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;25&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (25&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;&#x2264;&#xA0;BMI&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;30&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obese (BMI&#xA0;&#x2265;&#xA0;30&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The waist and hip circumferences were measured, and the waist-hip-ratio (WHR) was calculated as indirect assessment of abdominal fat. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured twice in a sitting position after 5&#xA0;min rest using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. The mean of the two measurements was used for the analyses. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure higher than 160&#xA0;mmHg, diastolic blood pressure higher than 100&#xA0;mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive medication indicated to treat high blood pressure (hypertension grades 2 and 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Diabetes was diagnosed based on a random or post-load glucose level higher than 11.0&#xA0;mmol/l and/or the use of anti-diabetic medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Total serum cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were measured using an automated enzymatic procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a total serum cholesterol level above 6.2&#xA0;mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The <italic>APOE</italic> genotype was determined on DNA samples using a polymerase chain reaction followed by enzymatic digestion using methods previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The frequencies of <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes were <italic>APOE</italic> 2/2 0.8%, <italic>APOE</italic> 2/3 12.8%, <italic>APOE</italic> 2/4 2.7%, <italic>APOE</italic> 3/3 58.4%, <italic>APOE</italic> 3/4 22.9% and <italic>APOE</italic> 4/4 2.4%. The proportions of the <italic>APOE</italic> alleles and genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.71).</p>

          <title>Mortality data</title>
          <p>Information on the vital status of the participants was obtained at regular intervals from the municipal population registry. Causes of death were obtained from the general practitioners by means of a standardized questionnaire relating to the circumstances of death, most likely cause of death and time and place of death. Two independent research physicians coded all events according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. CHD mortality was defined as death from diseases coded I20&#x2013;I25, I46, I50 or R96. Mortality data were available up to December 2003.</p>

        <title>Statistical analyses</title>
        <p>Of the 7,983 individuals who participated at baseline, 5,817 (73%) had <italic>APOE</italic> genotyped successfully and had complete information on BMI, WHR and cholesterol levels. Because persons with an extremely low BMI may suffer from life-threatening diseases such as cancer, individuals with a BMI below 18.5&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;51) were excluded from the analyses. Also, <italic>APOE</italic> 2/4 individuals were excluded from the analyses (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;158) to distinguish the effect of the <italic>APOE</italic> alleles unambiguously. Hence, data from 5,608 participants were available for the analyses.</p>
        <p>Differences in baseline characteristics by <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes were tested using the chi-squared statistic (categorical variables) or ANOVA (continuous variables). P for trend was obtained by testing the linearity of the sum of squares from the ANOVA analyses. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the interaction between <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and BMI on total serum cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels. Differences in survival probabilities were examined by comparing Kaplan-Meier survival curves and tested using the log rank test. Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed using age as the time scale to take proper account of the effect of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Risks of mortality were quantified as hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards analyses with age as the time scale. The most common genotype (<italic>APOE</italic> 3/3) was used as the reference category. The proportionality assumption of all models was verified by testing the Schoenfeld residuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Because the proportionality assumption was not met, HRs were calculated for early and late mortality using 80&#xA0;years as the cut-off age. This cut-off age was selected because it led to proportionality of the models below and above the cut-off age. HRs were calculated adjusted for gender, smoking status, education level, total serum cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, waist to hip ratio hypertension and diabetes mellitus.</p>

      <p>The mean age at entry was 68.7&#xA0;years (SD&#xA0;=&#xA0;8.7&#xA0;years) and 41.8% of the participants were men. The mean follow up time was 11.1&#xA0;years (SD&#xA0;=&#xA0;3.8&#xA0;years). Baseline characteristics of <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers, <italic>APOE*</italic>3 homozygotes and <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers are presented in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. As expected, cholesterol levels differed significantly between the genotype groups. The prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia was lowest among <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers (49%) and highest among <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers (66%). Furthermore, there were statistically significant differences in BMI scores between the genotype groups, with <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers having the highest mean BMI (26.7&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;3.6&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers the lowest (26.1&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;3.4&#xA0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). There were no statistically significant differences in WHR between the genotype groups.

Of those, 257 occurred in 782 <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers (33%), 1,160 in 3,369 <italic>APOE*</italic>3 homozygotes (33%) and 501 in 1,457 <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers (34%). Differences between the Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers, <italic>APOE*</italic>3 homozygotes and <italic>APOE*</italic>4 carriers were small but statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.03) with <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers having slightly lower mortality risks (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors, <italic>APOE</italic> genotype was not associated with all-cause mortality before or after 80&#xA0;years of age in the overall population (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The differences between the curves were only statistically significant in normal weight individuals (<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.04; Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Normal weight carriers of the <italic>APOE*</italic>2 allele had a significantly lower risk of mortality before age 80&#xA0;years (HR [95% CI]&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.7 [0.5&#x2013;0.9]), but not after age 80&#xA0;years (crude HR [95% CI]&#xA0;=&#xA0;1.0 [0.8&#x2013;1.4]). There were no significant differences in the risk of mortality between genotype groups among overweight or obese persons (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our study shows that the <italic>APOE*</italic>2 allele has a protective effect on overall mortality. This protective effect seems to be limited to mortality from CHD. Analyses within BMI strata demonstrated that this genetic advantage of <italic>APOE*</italic>2 was observed only in normal weight individuals, but not in overweight and obese <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers.</p>
      <p>The results of the present analyses may seem to contradict our earlier work in this population. We previously reported that the <italic>APOE</italic> gene was not significantly related to mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While our findings come from the same population, the mean follow-up time of the participants has increased from 5.4&#xA0;years to 11.1&#xA0;years and the number of deaths increased by 53% from 18% to 34%. This extended follow-up has improved the statistical power of our study to show a modest effect of <italic>APOE</italic> genotype on overall mortality. Research on the relationship between <italic>APOE</italic> and mortality has merely provided conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Three out of eleven studies showed a protective effect of <italic>APOE</italic>*2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. and three a deleterious effect of <italic>APOE</italic>*4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The latter effect may partly mediated by the increased risk of Alzheimer disease in association with <italic>APOE</italic>*4 and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Note that our analysis showed small significant difference in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, demonstrating a protective effect of <italic>APOE</italic>*2 before age 80. This may be due to the effect of age that becomes apparent when performing survival analysis with age as time scale, as we did in the present paper. Such finding is compatible with previous reports suggesting that genes affecting human lifespan might be age-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Genetic and environmental interactions at older ages vary from those at early ages and therefore explain the differences in the association between <italic>APOE</italic> and mortality before and after 80&#xA0;years of age. A previous report showed that among nonagenarians, <italic>APOE</italic> genotype has no effect on cognitive function, cognitive decline or survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>In line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we found that the total serum cholesterol levels associated with <italic>APOE</italic> genotype differed between normal weight, overweight and obese individuals. As expected, mean levels of total serum cholesterol increased with BMI and <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers had the lowest mean total serum cholesterol in each BMI group. <italic>APOE</italic>*4 carriers had higher cholesterol levels and lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations than <italic>APOE</italic>*2 carriers despite the presence of a lower BMI and equal WHR. Previous reports showed that <italic>APOE</italic> genotype, BMI and WHR determine together the lipid levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, in our study abdominal fat, as measured by WHR, did not have any effect on the lipid levels by <italic>APOE</italic> genotype, while BMI was an important determinant. The significant interaction between <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and BMI in relation to total serum cholesterol found previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], was also supported by this study. Although the mechanism of such interaction has not been yet elucidated, evidence suggests that obesity and abdominal fat increase low density lipoprotein cholesterol and therefore total cholesterol at a higher degree among <italic>APOE</italic>*4 carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This is in line with our observation that the deleterious effect of increased BMI prevails over the beneficial effects of the <italic>APOE</italic>*2 allele. Furthermore, previous research in the Rotterdam Study and the Dutch population indicated that among <italic>APOE</italic>*2 homozygous carriers, the expression of Hyperlipoproteinemia type III is determined to a great extent by hyperinsulinemia and the presence of insulin resistance syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], conferring and increased risk of CHD through accelerated atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although the association between high BMI and high cholesterol levels is well known and the <italic>APOE</italic> gene is associated with cholesterol levels as previously described, this is the first study that examined the effect of <italic>APOE</italic> genotype on mortality in BMI strata. We found that presence of the <italic>APOE*</italic>2 allele was associated with a decreased risk of mortality only in normal weight individuals and that this lower risk was partly explained by lower risk of CHD mortality. These results were in line with the lower total cholesterol and higher HDL levels among normal weight <italic>APOE</italic>*2 carriers. Our finding that the protective effect of <italic>APOE*</italic>2 was only found in normal weight individuals suggests that the negative influences of increasing BMI outweigh the positive effects of genetic predisposition. When these results are confirmed by other population-based studies, a challenging question remains whether weight loss in overweight and obese <italic>APOE*</italic>2 carriers restores the genetic advantage of their <italic>APOE</italic> status.</p>
