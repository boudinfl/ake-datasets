        <p>The MYB transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of many secondary metabolites at the transcriptional level. We evaluated the possible roles of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> R2R3-MYB transcription factors in flavonoid biosynthesis because they are induced by UV-B irradiation but their associated phenotypes are largely unexplored. We isolated their genes by RACE-PCR, and performed transgenic approach and metabolite analyses in lettuce (<italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>). We found that one member of this protein family, AtMYB60, inhibits anthocyanin biosynthesis in the lettuce plant. Wild-type lettuce normally accumulates anthocyanin, predominantly cyanidin and traces of delphinidin, and develops a red pigmentation. However, the production and accumulation of anthocyanin pigments in <italic>AtMYB60</italic>-overexpressing lettuce was inhibited. Using RT-PCR analysis, we also identified the complete absence or reduction of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) transcripts in <italic>AtMYB60-</italic> overexpressing lettuce (AtMYB60-117 and AtMYB60-112 lines). The correlation between the overexpression of <italic>AtMYB60</italic> and the inhibition of anthocyanin accumulation suggests that the transcription factorAtMYB60 controls anthocyanin biosynthesis in the lettuce leaf. Clarification of the roles of the <italic>AtMYB60</italic> transcription factor will facilitate further studies and provide genetic tools to better understand the regulation in plants of the genes controlled by the MYB-type transcription factors. Furthermore, the characterization of AtMYB60 has implications for the development of new varieties of lettuce and other commercially important plants with metabolic engineering approaches.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Flavonoid metabolism is unique to plants and produces a great number and variety of compounds including flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanins (Winkel-Shirley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). These molecules play important roles in many fundamental processes in plants, such as the pigmentation of flowers and fruits, UV resistance, pollen fertility, responses to wounding and fungal attacks, and environmental stress responses (Shirley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1995</xref>; Weisshaar and Jenkins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1998</xref>; Harborne and Williams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>; Dixon and Piava <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1995</xref>; Moyano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>; Pietta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>; Cominelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>). The regulation of the anthocyanin pigments in plants is particularly important in metabolic engineering applications because these compounds act as visual signals that attract the insects and animals required for pollination and seed dispersal (Holton and Cornish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1995</xref>).</p>
      <p>The metabolic pathways involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis are well established, and the central pathways in this process are highly conserved in plants (Shih et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>). Moreover, studies in model plants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and maize, have facilitated a sound understanding of the genes involved and the assembly of the relevant enzyme complexes (Winkel-Shirley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>). Two groups of genes are required for anthocyanin biosynthesis: structural genes that encode the enzymes that directly participate in the biosynthetic reactions, and genes for transcription factors that regulate the expression of these structural genes and the accumulation of flavonoid metabolites. Transcription factors can act as activators or repressors of gene expression, and mediate either increases or decreases in transcription through sequence-specific DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Broun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>MYB proteins have been identified in a large number of eukaryotes, including fungi, plants and vertebrates (Ohi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>; Martin and Paz-Ares <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>; Slamon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1986</xref>), and have roles in a wide array of cellular processes. These include the regulation of secondary metabolism, signal transduction, cell division, and responses to plant diseases and various forms of stress (UV-B light, cold and drought) (Larkin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1994</xref>; Borevitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>; Stracke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>; Vailleau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>; Cominelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>). The R2R3-MYB-related proteins activate the transcription of structural genes that function in different branches of phenylpropanoid metabolism (Martin and Paz-Ares <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>). The promoters of these structural genes each contain potential MYB protein recognition motifs and also bind with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and conserved WD40 repeat proteins (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">b</xref>; Martin and Paz-Ares <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>; Winkel-Shirley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>The classification of MYB transcription factors is based on the strong conservation of imperfect repeats in the MYB DNA-binding domain of the member proteins (Martin and Paz-Ares <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>). In contrast to animals (R1R2R3), the MYB domain transcription factors found in plants are characterized by the R2R3-type MYB domain, comprising a DNA-binding domain and an activation/repression domain. Moreover, the balance between activators and repressors in this transcription factor family in plants may provide extra flexibility in terms of transcriptional control (Jin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>). There have been 126 R2R3 MYB genes identified in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, all of which exhibit strong homology within their N-terminal MYB DNA-binding domains and can be divided into 24 subgroups on the basis of their sequences (Stracke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>; Riechmann and Ratcliffe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>; Kranz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>). To determine the biological roles of the MYB-related transcription factors in the production of phenylpropanoids, we isolated six R2R3-MYB proteins from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> based on available information indicating that these genes are induced by environmental stress (UV-B irradiation) (Kranz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>). However, they do not have an informative phenotype, because of the structural and functional redundancy among these factors (Bouche and Bouchez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>). Furthermore, although there have been other studies of anthocyanin accumulation in lettuce, one of the most popular and commercially important vegetables in the world, this process has not been characterized before at the level of transcriptional regulation. The regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in plants is also a key issue in our understanding of the regulation of leaf color. The identification of the factors that exert this control will provide valuable tools to moderate the extent and distribution of anthocyanin-derived pigmentation in plant tissues.</p>
      <p>In this study, we overexpressed the <italic>AtMYB60</italic> gene in lettuce plants (&#x201C;Jinjachuckmyun&#x201D; cultivar) that are highly pigmented with a red color throughout their leaf tissues. Because the loss of these pigments is easily detected, the activity and repression of the MYB-type transcription factors that affect these pathways can be investigated. In the leaves of lettuce, coordinated transcriptional regulation controls virtually each step of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007a</xref>). We compared the expression of the major anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and the AtMYB60 gene by RT-PCR. We show that this transcription factor is functionally active in repressing anthocyanin accumulation and can thus generate green lettuce leaves. We also show, by functionally repressing the accumulation of this compound, that <italic>AtMYB60</italic> plays a significant role in controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis via the inhibition of a key target gene encoding dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR). Thus, we report here for the first time that anthocyanin biosynthesis and the transcription of the <italic>DFR</italic> gene are repressed through the overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> R2R3-MYB transcription factors in transgenic lettuce plants. We also discuss the function of transcriptional regulators in the control of the expression of the structural protein that are required for anthocyanin biosynthesis in lettuce.</p>

        <p>To investigate the effects of exogenous AtMYB proteins on anthocyanin biosynthesis in lettuce leaves at the molecular level, Jinjachuckmyun plants, supplied by Syngenta (Seoul, Korea), were used. The plants were grown at the National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology in Suwon, South Korea.

        <title>Generation of <italic>AtMYB</italic> transgenic lettuce</title>
        <p>Transgenic lettuce plants were generated using the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation of cotyledons. Lettuce seeds of the Jinjachuckmyun cultivar were supplied by Syngenta (Korea) and were surface sterilized in 25% (v/v) bleach for 7&#xA0;min, washed (three changes) in sterile water, and placed on phytogel-solidified (0.2%, w/v) MS medium at pH&#xA0;5.8. The seeds were germinated and maintained at 25&#xB0;C (16&#xA0;h photoperiod, 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;mol&#xA0;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xA0;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, daylight fluorescent tubes). The cotyledons were excised from the 4-day-old lettuce seedling and inoculated with freshly grown <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>. The inoculated cotyledons were then co-cultivated on MS salt medium solidified with 0.2% purified phytogel (Sigma, USA), for 2&#xA0;days at 24&#xB0;C in the dark. The cotyledon explants were then transferred to shoot initiation medium supplemented with 400&#xA0;mg&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> carbenicillin (Duchefa, the Netherlands). After a washing step, these explants were cultured (ten per plate) on selection medium (MS salt 4.43&#xA0;g&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, sucrose 30&#xA0;g&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, phytogel 2&#xA0;g&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, kinetin 0.5&#xA0;mg&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, carbenicillin 400&#xA0;mg&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, phosphinothricin 1.0&#xA0;mg&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and cysteine 10&#xA0;mg&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and subcultured every 2&#xA0;weeks on the same medium. Shoots that regenerated from explants on medium containing phosphinothricin were rooted in rooting medium (MS salt 4.43&#xA0;g&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, sucrose 30&#xA0;g&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, phytogel 2&#xA0;g&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and phosphinothricin 1.0&#xA0;mg&#xA0;l<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), before transfer to the greenhouse, where they were allowed to self-pollinate and to set seed.

        <title>Anthocyanin extraction and HPLC analysis</title>
        <p>Anthocyanin in the lettuce plants was quantified by HPLC at a detection wavelength of 510&#xA0;nm, comparing the sample retention times and peaks with those of known standards. The relative quantification of each phenolic compound samples was expressed as the equivalent quantity of purified standards for each treatment.</p>
        <p>About 0.2&#xA0;g of ground and freeze-dried leaves was accurately weighed and extracted with 1&#xA0;ml of a solution of methanol:water (80:20, v/v) at 80&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;h, then sonicated for 20&#xA0;min. The extracted solution was filtered into a 50-ml volumetric flask, and the flask and filter were rinsed with a solution of methanol:water (80:20, v/v). The filtrate was then made up to the required volume with the same solvent. Approximately 1&#xA0;mL of the sample solution was passed through a 0.4&#xA0;&#x3BC;m filter before analysis by HPLC. A Shimadzu HPLC system with 10AD dual pumps was used, with an RP18 (LiChrospher, 250&#xA0;mm&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;4&#xA0;mm&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;5&#xA0;&#x3BC;m) column. The HPLC parameters were as follows: column temperature 30&#xB0;C, solvent A&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, solvent B&#xA0;=&#xA0;98% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, solvent gradient, 0&#xA0;min&#xA0;=&#xA0;0% B, 3&#xA0;min&#xA0;=&#xA0;6% B 12&#xA0;min&#xA0;=&#xA0;18% B, 25&#xA0;min&#xA0;=&#xA0;25% B, 35&#xA0;min&#xA0;=&#xA0;100% B, 40&#xA0;min&#xA0;=&#xA0;100% B. The flow rate was 0.35&#xA0;mL&#xA0;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The peaks were classified as either cyanidin or delphinidin derivatives by UV spectral analysis.</p>

        <p>More than 20 independent transgenic plants, selected with barstar spray and subsequently confirmed by PCR analysis (data not shown), were obtained with each <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> strain. There was a large variation in the leaf color phenotypes of these transgenic lines.

Under standard growth conditions, transgenic lettuce plants of the T1 generation that overexpressed <italic>AtMYB60</italic> under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter showed an inhibition (AtMYB60-117) of anthocyanin accumulation (green leaves), compared with that of wild-type plants (red leaves) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b).

        <title>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of <italic>AtMYB60</italic> transgenic lettuce shows that accumulation of anthocyanin compounds is inhibited</title>
        <p>To confirm the identity of the anthocyanins that are synthesized in lettuce after transformation with <italic>AtMYB</italic> genes, lettuce leaf tissues were harvested and analyzed by HPLC for the presence of soluble anthocyanins. The results confirmed the predominance of cyanidin in the wild-type lettuce leaves, with traces of delphinidin also evident, as we previously described (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007a</xref>). The cyanidin and delphinidin peaks were detected in the AtMYB4-overexpressing lettuce (AtMYB4-101) and wild-type lettuce. The <italic>AtMYB29</italic>-, <italic>AtMYB30</italic>-, <italic>AtMYB34</italic>- and <italic>AtMYB51</italic>-overexpressing lettuce plants that showed a similar red-colored phenotype also produced corresponding cyanidin and delphinidin peaks on HPLC analysis (data not shown). However, clear differences were evident in the patterns of anthocyanin accumulation in the <italic>AtMYB60</italic>-overexpressing lettuce plants (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). With HPLC, we found that the cyanidin (red pigment) peak was absent or sharply reduced in AtMYB60-117 and AtMYB60-112. The delphinidin (blue pigment) peak was absent in every <italic>AtMYB60</italic>-overpxpressing lines. Hence, the anthocyanin derivatives detected in lettuce leaves by HPLC can be correlated with the morphologies of the plants and with the inhibition of anthocyanin biosynthesis by the AtMYB60 protein.

        <title>RNA expression profiles of anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes suggest their coordinated regulation in AtMYB60 transgenic lettuce plants</title>
        <p>Based on the correlation between the plant color morphology and our HPLC analysis of the anthocyanins, we undertook to verify the effects of the AtMYB proteins on the expression of the structural genes encoding the enzymes responsible for anthocyanin biosynthesis. As shown in Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, a dramatic leaf color change was evident in the AtMYB60-117 (green leaf) and -112 (mosaic phenotype) lines, in which anthocyanin accumulation is inhibited, and these plants showed a strong green leaf color phenotype. The enzymes that act in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway have been well characterized in lettuce in our previous study (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007a</xref>), in which we also analyzed the expression of the structural genes encoding the relevant enzymes. Following environmental stimuli such as UV-B irradiation, the expression of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) is positively induced, and the accumulation of anthocyanin is increased in lettuce. We also performed RT-PCR analysis using gene-specific primers in that study to analyze the expression of these structural genes. They were identified from young UV-B-irradiated lettuce leaves and designated as CHS (CV700441), F3H (CV700152), DFR (CV700105) and UFGT (CV700246) (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007a</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>To isolate the MYB-type transcription factor genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism, the transgenic expression of six <italic>AtMYB</italic> genes was analyzed in lettuce. To date, a large number of transcription factors containing DNA-binding domains that are similar to those of the MYB proteins have been identified across the eukaryotic kingdom (Kranz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1998</xref>). Several MYB transcription factors are known to regulate phenylpropanoid metabolism, and the quantities of the various end-products of the associated pathways that accumulate in specific cells, tissues and organs are thought to respresent the balanced expression of several interacting MYB proteins (Tamagnone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1998</xref>; Espley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>). Recently, biochemical studies have also suggested that the MYB-type transcription factors are involved in regulating the branches of the phenylpropanoid metabolic networks in higher plants. Multiple MYBs are also thought to regulate the expression of the structural proteins that drive several downstream pathways of flavonoid metabolism (Moyano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>). A previous study has also shown that MYB proteins can regulate flavonoid biosynthesis via the transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding <italic>CHS</italic>, an enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in flavonoid biosynthesis (Feldbrugge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>The lettuce cultivar &#x201C;Jinjachuckmyun&#x201D;, which we used in our current transformation experiments, shows anthocyanin pigment accumulation in its leaves during development. We have shown in a recent study that environmental stresses upregulate the expression of the genes that encode anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes in this same lettuce variety, as demonstrated by their responsiveness to UV-B irradiation (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007a</xref>).</p>
      <p>The lettuce has merit as a model plant system to further characterize the functions of those gene products in anthocyanin metabolism, because of its leaf color is red under field conditions and green under chamber condition when exposed to UV-B irradiation. The findings described in this study further validate the use of lettuce as a model plant because it offers experimental versatility in terms of its genetic regulation of the inhibition of leaf pigmentation. The function of the MYB proteins as activators (green to red in a growth chamber) or repressors (red to green in the field) of anthocyanin biosynthesis can be characterized directly from a phenotypic analysis of the lettuce leaf color. This system has potential applications as a research tool in a number of areas of plant molecular biology.</p>
      <p>We show in our present experiments that the anthocyanin accumulation in leaves is strongly inhibited in <italic>AtMYB60</italic> transgenic plants compared with that in wild-type plants (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b). These results suggest that <italic>AtMYB60</italic> functions as a repressor of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Based upon our current findings of the inhibition of anthocyanin biosynthesis and our metabolite analysis of <italic>AtMYB60</italic>-overexpressing lettuce plants compared with the wild-type, we speculate that the synthesis of anthocyanin is principally controlled by the <italic>AtMYB60</italic> transcription factor. The production of anthocyanin is inhibited in the AtMYB60-117 and AtMYB60-112 lines, and this is likely to underlie the green leaf phenotype of these plants. Hence, this characterization of the function of <italic>AtMYB60</italic> represents a crucial step in furthering our understanding of the molecular regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and the transcription of related genes in lettuce and other plants. It is noteworthy in this context that MYB-related proteins generally act as transcriptional activators (Foos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1994</xref>).</p>
      <p>The R2R3-MYB-related proteins have so far been shown to activate the transcription of structural proteins that act in different branches of the phenylpropanoid metabolism machinery (Martin and Paz-Ares <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>) or that play roles in the plant response to stress signals (Cominelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>). Anthocyanin expression in maize is dependent on the presence of both the MYB and MYC types of regulatory factors. It is of some interest, therefore, that in this study, the expression of <italic>AtMYB60</italic> alone, under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, was sufficient to repress anthocyanin accumulation in a red lettuce variety.</p>
      <p>We also investigated the effects of <italic>AtMYB60</italic> on the expression of the different structural proteins involved in anthocyanin production, which we have identified previously in lettuce. Our results reveal that this MYB protein represses the expression of the <italic>DFR</italic> gene in the AtMYB-117 and -112 lines. Significantly, DFR is a crucial structural protein that facilitates anthocyanin pigmentation in lettuce and that no such reduction in the expression of this gene was found in the wild-type or AtMYB4-101 lines that also develop red-colored leaves. The DFR protein represents an important branching point within the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and catalyzes the commitment step in this process, which is the formation of leucoanthocyanidins from the substrate dihydroflavonol. This indicates that <italic>AtMYB60</italic> specifically inhibits the flux of flavonoid intermediates toward the production of leucoanthocyanins by repressing the transcription of <italic>DFR</italic>, with a resulting green leaf phenotype (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).
<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#xA0;7</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the relationship between <italic>AtMYB60</italic> expression and the structural proteins that play roles in anthocyanin biosynthesis</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="299_2008_521_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig></p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that the transcriptional response to UV-B irradiation that operates through <italic>AtMYB60</italic> focuses on the regulation of <italic>DFR</italic> expression and anthocyanin accumulation. Recently there has been some debate about the identity of the phenylpropanoids involved in the response to UV-B, which may provide the most effective components of sunscreen formulations. MYB transcription factors that are known to regulate the transcription of genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway have been studied previously (Jin and Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1999</xref>). The overexpression of PAP1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> results in the up-regulation of the genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), CHS and DFR (Borevitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>; Tohge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>). Moreover, mutations in the <italic>CHS</italic>, <italic>DFR</italic> and <italic>LDOX</italic> genes reduce the pigmentation of plants (Shirley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1995</xref>; Abrahams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>), suggesting that these proteins are required for the synthesis of both anthocyanidin and proanthocyanidin. Because MYB-binding sites are present in the promoter regions of these flavonoid biosynthetic genes (Nesi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>; Debeaujon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>), it is possible that the AtMYB60 transcription factor might also specifically and directly target them. It is also possible that additional target genes that are related to phenylpropanoid metabolism can be negatively regulated by <italic>AtMYB60</italic> when it is overexpressed in lettuce.</p>
      <p>The effects of <italic>AtMYB60</italic> suggest that this MYB protein acts as a direct transcriptional regulator by binding to the MYB motifs common to the promoters of many structural genes in the same metabolic pathway, thus resulting in the downregulation of this pathway. The precise determination of this regulatory system at the molecular level remains to be achieved. Recently, Cominelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>) reported that <italic>AtMYB60</italic> is involved in the plant response to stress and its expression is negatively modulated during conditions of drought (Cominelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>). A null mutation in <italic>AtMYB60</italic> results in a constitutive reduction in stomatal openings and in decreased wilting under water-stress conditions. Therefore, we hypothesize that AtMYB60 has multiple functions in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and in the plant responses to different environmental conditions, including drought and exposure to UV-B light.</p>
      <p>AtMYB60 is the first MYB protein identified that functions as a transcriptional repressor of the lettuce <italic>DFR</italic> gene in anthocyanin biosynthesis, and thus extends the known roles of the R2R3-MYB proteins in secondary metabolism. Evidence from our transgenic lettuce experiments suggests that the direct repression exerted by AtMYB60 protein produces phenotypic effects in transgenic plants. The engineering of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway is potentially of great commercial significance. Because the AtMYB60 transcription factor should act effectively in most plant species, it can potentially be used to control anthocyanin biosynthesis in agriculturally and industrially important plants. This method of modifying the anthocyanin content in plant tissues also opens up new avenues to engineering improvements in commercial crops by altering metabolic pathways via the regulation of different structural genes in these pathways.</p>
