        <p>DNA fragmentation factor is a heterodimer complex of the nuclease CAD and its specific inhibitor ICAD, which can be activated during apoptosis to induce DNA fragmentation. Although ICAD expression levels have been quantified in a variety of human cancer cells, the mechanism of ICAD gene regulation remains unknown. In this study, we identified a 106-bp TATA-less region upstream of the transcription start site as a basal promoter of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene. An E-Box motif, which binds transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family, is responsible for transcriptional activity, as demonstrated using mutated promoter-reporters. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further demonstrated that Myc binds to an endogenous <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter. The functional importance of Myc in the regulation of <italic>ICAD</italic> transcription was also demonstrated by knock-down of <italic>c-Myc</italic> and <italic>N-Myc</italic> gene expression, as well as their ectopic expression. Structural analysis of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter and identification of factors which regulate its activity might further our understanding of the biological role of ICAD with respect to regulation of apoptosis and cancer development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Apoptosis or programmed cell death ensures the elimination of unwanted cells during normal development and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This process is progressively inactivated during malignant development and loss of the capacity for apoptosis is a hallmark of malignant cells. Chromatin condensation and internucleasomal DNA fragmentation are typical nuclear features and well-recognized events in apoptosis. DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is a heterodimer protein composed of a 40-kDa caspase-activated DNase (CAD) otherwise known as DFF40, and its cognate 45-kDa inhibitor (inhibitor of CAD: ICAD or DFF45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Both human genes map to 1p36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. CAD is thought to be responsible for the majority of nuclear activity resulting in chromosomal DNA fragmentation. When apoptosis is activated, ICAD is cleaved by executor caspases, mainly caspase-3, into three fragments, after which it dissociates from CAD, resulting in CAD activation.</p>
      <p>Thus, the DFF complex may play a role in malignant transformation, and up- or down-regulation of ICAD/CAD expression might correlate with cancer aggression. Expression levels of ICAD have been examined in a variety of human cancers. For example, ICAD expression is down-regulated during the exponential growth phase of human colon carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In some neuroblastomas, preferential ICAD expression is observed in low-stage, but not in their high grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other research suggests that down-regulation of ICAD may contribute to tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in esophageal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and that ICAD expression might serve as a marker of aggressive tumor behavior with an associated poor prognosis in ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that the hepatitis C virus core protein, which not only encodes the viral nucleocapsid but has a number of properties enabling persistent viral infection, induces gene expression of <italic>ICAD</italic>, thereby increasing steady-state levels of the ICAD protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To date, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene is not well understood. Analysis of the gene structure of mouse <italic>ICAD</italic> showed that a 118-bp flanking region of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene is required for promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, we identified a functional promoter of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene and investigated the role of c-Myc and N-Myc in regulation of the <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter.</p>

        <title>Localization of transcription start sites of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene</title>
        <p>Precise localization of transcription start sites of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene was examined in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells by 5&#x2032;-RACE analysis. A fragment of approximately 100&#xA0;bp was obtained (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) and cloned, after which sequencing analysis of several cDNA clones identified two of 5&#x2032; termini (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). These were located 71 and 68 nucleotides upstream from the translation start codon of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene. From a database search of the DBTSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we found that these are two of multiple sites for putative transcription initiation for the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene. Although transcription may be initiated at both sites, the upper site was designated position +1 in this study.

        <title>Characterization of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene promoter</title>
        <p>To examine potential regulatory sequences involved in <italic>ICAD</italic> gene expression, a 1&#xA0;kb 5&#x2032;-upstream region of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene was sequenced and analyzed. The overall GC content of the 1-kb genomic DNA fragment was 46%, while GC content among the 200&#xA0;bp proximal to the ATG start codon was approximately 62%. A search of transcription consensus motifs using the TRANSFAC database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] demonstrated that none of the major eukaryotic promoter elements, TATA-, CCAAT-, or GC box, were located within 200&#xA0;bp upstream of the transcription start site, although a TATA-like element was found more than 400&#xA0;bp upstream from the start sites, indicating that the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene has a TATA-less promoter. No CpG island, which is frequently observed in the TATA-less promoter, was found by screening with the CpG island searcher (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cpgislands.usc.edu/">http://cpgislands.usc.edu/</ext-link>). Absence of a TATA-like sequence upstream of the transcription start site has also been reported for the mouse ICAD gene, suggesting that TATA-less promoters might be a common feature in transcriptional regulation of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, the 1-kb sequence contains potential binding sites for several transcription factors. The ability of the 5&#x2032;-upstream region of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene to function as a promoter was assessed by its capacity to drive the expression of a luciferase reporter gene. A series of constructs in which genomic DNA fragments were fused to a promoterless firefly luciferase gene of the pGL3-basic vector were generated with the 3&#x2032; end always terminating +71&#xA0;bp from the transcription start site. The 5&#x2032; ends began at bases &#x2212;936, &#x2212;662, &#x2212;272, &#x2212;205, &#x2212;145, &#x2212;106, &#x2212;90, and &#x2212;43 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Promoter activity was assessed by measuring luciferase activity in transiently transfected Huh-7 cells. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. As shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> on the right, the region extending from &#x2212;936 to +71 had promoter activity since luciferase activity of the reporter gene was 45-fold that of the empty vector. A 5&#x2032; deletion of the promoter sequence to &#x2212;662(pLuc(&#x2212;662/+71)) enhanced promoter activity, and successive removal of nucleotides from &#x2212;272 to &#x2212;106 also enhanced promoter activity, suggesting the possibility of negative regulatory elements within the &#x2212;936/&#x2212;622 and &#x2212;272/&#x2212;106 regions. When the sequence from &#x2212;106 to &#x2212;90 was removed (pLuc(&#x2212;90/+71)), promoter activity fell to parallel that of the pGL3 basic vector. This suggests the presence of a critical element in the region extending from &#x2212;106 to &#x2212;90, thus, we have identified the region 106&#xA0;bp upstream of the transcription start site as the basal promoter of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene.

        <title>Myc and USF enhance <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter activity</title>
        <p>As indicated in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, a computer-based sequence analysis revealed that the 106&#xA0;bp region contains potential binding sites for GATA-1, deltaE, Myc, and various upstream stimulatory factors (USF). Within this region, there is a canonical E-box sequence (5&#x2032;-CACGTG-3&#x2032;) located between &#x2212;103 and &#x2212;98. E box motifs are known to bind to transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH LZ) family, including Myc and USF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We examined the potential role of E-box-binding proteins, Myc and USF, in potentiating <italic>ICAD</italic> gene transcription. Myc is bound to a partner protein Max via a bHLH LZ domain and the Myc-Max heterodimer activates transcription by binding to an E-box sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Max is present in greater amounts than Myc since the Myc transcript and protein have shorter half-lives compared to Max [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, it is highly likely that Myc is the limiting, regulated component of the heterodimer. To examine the potential role of E box binding proteins, Huh-7 cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids and expression vectors for c-Myc, N-Myc, USF1, and USF2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Luciferase activity of the &#x2212;145/+71 promoter construct increased 2- to 5-fold, and 1.5- to 2-fold, when co-expressed with Myc or USF, respectively. The effect of c-Myc and N-Myc on activity of the &#x2212;90/+71 construct was less than for the &#x2212;145/+71 construct. USF expression did not enhance activity of the &#x2212;90/+71 construct.

RLU is expressed as a percentage of that of pLuc(&#x2212;106/&#xB1;71) without over-expression of Myc</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10495_2008_223_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
        <p>To further investigate involvement of the E box sequence in <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter activity, a reporter construct with an E box mutation (CCCGCG) was constructed and luciferase activity was examined in transfected cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The E box mutation resulted in marked down-regulation of reporter gene expression and the reporter activity expressed from the E-box mutant was little increased when co-expressed with Myc, suggesting a functionally important role of the &#x2212;106/&#x2212;90 region E box motif with regard to basal transcriptional activation of the <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter. These data indicates that E-box-binding proteins, especially Myc, actively participate in positive regulation of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter.</p>

        <title>Myc binds to the <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter in vivo</title>
        <p>To obtain direct evidence of an interaction between Myc and the <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter in vivo, we next examined binding of c-Myc and N-Myc to the 5&#x2032;-upstream region of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene within the context of native chromatin in living cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation. An alignment of the sequence around putative Myc binding site of human <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter and the corresponding part of mouse <italic>ICAD</italic> sequence demonstrated conservation of Myc binding sequence in human and mouse (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Proteins were cross-linked to genomic DNA isolated not only from human (Huh-7) but mouse (IMR-32 and GOTO) cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit IgG or polyclonal antibodies to either c-Myc or N-Myc. IMR-32 and GOTO are neuroblastoma cells with <italic>N-Myc</italic> gene amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The precipitated DNA was then subjected to PCR utilizing primers designed to amplify a 343-bp fragment (&#x2212;272/+71) or a 338&#xA0;bp fragment (&#x2212;789/&#x2212;451) of the <italic>ICAD</italic> 5&#x2032; flanking region. As shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, the 343-bp DNA fragment was observed in the immunoprecipitate from Huh-7 cells following exposure to anti-c-Myc or anti-N-Myc, while amplification of the <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter fragment was not detected in the negative control immunoprecipitate. Under similar experimental conditions, we did not detect binding of c-Myc and N-Myc to the &#x2212;789/&#x2212;451 region, which is not thought to contain a Myc-binding site. Similar results were obtained from IMR-32 and GOTO cells, which were immunoprecipitated with anti-N-Myc antibody. These results demonstrate that Myc forms a complex with the human <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter in cells, presumably through binding to the E-box sequence.

        <title>Myc-dependent expression of the ICAD protein</title>
        <p>The above data suggests that the <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter is regulated by endogenous Myc proteins. This assumption is supported by the loss-of-function studies shown in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a. We employed siRNA (small interference RNA) transfection to knock-down the expression of c-Myc or N-Myc in cells, after which we analyzed the effect of reduced Myc expression on steady state levels of the ICAD protein by Western blotting. Treatment with siRNA specific for either c-Myc or N-Myc markedly reduced ICAD expression without affecting the expression of &#x3B2;-actin. In contrast, control siRNA did not reduce ICAD levels. We further investigated the effect of over-expression of Myc on ICAD protein levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Transfection of Huh-7 and mouse 3T3 cells with a c-Myc or N-Myc expression vector enhanced ICAD protein levels with an effect that was less pronounced than in the loss-of-function studies, but reproducible nonetheless. These results suggest an important role of Myc proteins in positive regulation of ICAD expression.
<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#xA0;5</label><caption><p>Myc-dependent expression of human ICAD. (<bold>a</bold>) Suppression of Myc expression decreases expression of ICAD protein. Huh-7 cells were transiently transfected with Myc siRNA (c-Myc, N-Myc) or the control siRNA (cont). Three days later, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting. (<bold>b</bold>) Ectopic expression of Myc increases expression of ICAD protein. Cells (Huh-7 and mouse 3T3) were transfected with the expression vector for c-Myc or N-Myc, and after 3&#xA0;days the cells were harvested for Western blotting.

Levels of mRNA expression of ICAD and c-Myc were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR based on Taq Man chemistry. Results, relative to &#x3B2;-actin mRNA, are depicted as averages with SD (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;3)</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10495_2008_223_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
        <p>Finally, we examined if there might be a correlation between <italic>ICAD</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic> expression levels in cancer cell lines. The mRNA expression of <italic>ICAD</italic> and <italic>c-Myc</italic> in human oral squamous cell carcinomas (Ca22-9, HSC-2, and HSC-3), in which <italic>ICAD</italic> expression has not been investigated to date, as well as in Huh-7 cells during their late exponential phase of growth, was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). <italic>ICAD</italic> mRNA was readily detected in all cancer cells but the expression level was not consistent. A relatively high level of expression was observed in Ca22-9 and HSC-3 cells, while HSC-2 cells demonstrated the lowest. Interestingly, expression pattern of <italic>c-Myc</italic> mRNA in these cell lines showed a tendency similar to that of ICAD, suggesting an important role of Myc in ICAD expression in human cancers. A large scale analysis for investigating correlation between ICAD and Myc expression in a variety of cancer tissues obtained from patients is ongoing.</p>
        <p>Several studies have shown up- or down-regulation of ICAD in a variety of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although transcriptional deregulation is presumably involved in this aberrant expression of ICAD, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of <italic>ICAD</italic> in human cells. This work was done to characterize the human <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter and to examine transcription factors which may be involved in its regulation. We experimentally determined putative transcription start sites by employing the 5&#x2032;-RACE method, and identified a promoter region required for basal <italic>ICAD</italic> gene expression using promoter-reporter constructs with progressive deletions. A combined study of site-directed mutagenesis of a reporter construct and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the importance of an E box Myc-binding motif located at position &#x2212;103 to &#x2212;98 from the transcription start sites, as well as an in vivo interaction between c-Myc and N-Myc and the proximal <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrated the functional importance of Myc proteins with regard to transcriptional regulation of the ICAD gene from studies examining ectopic expression of c-Myc and N-Myc, as well as with RNAi technology. We showed that expression levels of ICAD and Myc correlate in some tumors.</p>
        <p>c-Myc and N-Myc are transcription factors of the bHLH LZ family that bind to the E box sequence within promoters to control proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. <italic>c-myc</italic> and <italic>N-myc</italic> genes are deregulated in a number of human cancers and influence proliferation and growth. A link between Myc and cancer is well established both in vivo and in vitro, and oncogenic activation of Myc has been observed to promote the development of a number of clinically significant cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Myc-mediated transformation are not fully understood. Although a variety of Myc target genes were identified and recruitment of Myc to the target promoters such as prothymosin and telomerase were shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], there has been no direct evidence on involvement of Myc in regulation of ICAD expression. It is known that c-Myc activation usually occurs during the later stages of carcinoma in humans. Conversely, in premalignant cells, c-Myc is a robust stimulator of apoptosis and programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. One area of investigation into cancer cell death mechanisms centers on the mechanism by which c-Myc stimulates or suppresses apoptosis. For instance, Myc has been reported to potentiate apoptosis through both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Myc controls the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors at the level of the mitochondria, thereby regulating cytochrome C release and activation of downstream caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Involvement of Myc in up-regulation of ICAD expression as demonstrated in this study might present a novel mechanism of Myc-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. It is possible that elevated levels of ICAD in cells inhibit activation of endonuclear activity, thereby increasing the threshold for apoptosis signaling.</p>
        <p>Kawane et&#xA0;al. have reported on the structure and analyzed the promoter of a murine <italic>ICAD</italic> gene, by which they demonstrated that a 118-bp flanking region of the <italic>ICAD</italic> gene is required for its transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The mouse sequence shares approximately 82% homology with a corresponding upstream region of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene. The mouse <italic>ICAD</italic> promoter has a number of potential binding sites for transcription factors, such as Ikaros, c-Rel, Myc, and Gfi-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Conservation of the Myc-binding motif among human and murine promoters suggests a functional significance of Myc in transcriptional regulation of <italic>ICAD</italic> expression.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this is the first report to identify a functional promoter of the human <italic>ICAD</italic> gene, and to demonstrate that Myc proteins are able to positively regulate ICAD gene expression. Extensive apoptosis research to date has shown that tumor aggression depends on various defects in apoptosis signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Further investigation into the molecular events linking Myc expression with <italic>ICAD</italic> gene regulation may provide insight into Myc&#x2019;s role in cell proliferation, transformation and apoptosis.</p>
