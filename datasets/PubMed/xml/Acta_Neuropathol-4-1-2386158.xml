      <abstract>
        <p>Peroxiredoxin 6 is an antioxidant enzyme and is the 1-cys member of the peroxiredoxin family. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting, we have shown for the first time that, in human control and brain tissue of patient&#x2019;s with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD), this enzyme exists as three major and five minor forms with pIs from 5.3 to 6.1. Using specific cellular markers, we have shown that peroxiredoxin 6 is present in astrocytes with very low levels in neurons, but not detectable in microglia or oligodendrocytes. In control brains, there was a very low level of peroxiredoxin 6 staining in astrocytes that was confined to a &#x201C;halo&#x201D; around the nucleus. In AD, there were marked increases in the number and staining intensity of peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes in both gray and white matter in the midfrontal cortex, cingulate, hippocampus and amygdala. Confocal microscopy using antibodies to A&#x3B2; peptide, tau and peroxiredoxin 6 showed that peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes are closely involved with diffuse plaques and to a lesser extent with neuritic plaques, suggesting that plaques are producing reactive oxygen species. There appeared to be little astrocytic response to tau containing neurons. Although peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes were seen to make multiple contacts with tau positive neurons, there was no intraneuronal colocalization. In brain tissue of patients with AD, many blood vessels exhibited peroxiredoxin 6 staining that appeared to be due to the astrocytic foot processes. These results suggest that oxidative stress conditions exist in AD and that peroxiredoxin 6 is an important antioxidant enzyme in human brain defenses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive decline in memory, language, cognition and motor functions. The neuropathological hallmarks of AD are the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques containing the amyloid beta peptide (A&#x3B2;) and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. Although the initiating molecular event(s) in AD are not known, oxidative stress produced by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) appears to be a fundamental process contributing to the neuropathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Whether oxidative stress has a role in the cause or affect in AD has been debated for many years, but recent research has suggested that it occurs prior to the onset of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The histopathological evidence for oxidative stress in AD includes lipid, protein and DNA oxidation. There is evidence to suggest that oxidative stress is generated peripherally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with the brain being particularly susceptible, but there is also a body of evidence to suggest that amyloid &#x3B2; peptide (A&#x3B2;42) may be linked to lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which may then be linked to the phosphorylation of tau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Two reactive products of A&#x3B2;42-induced lipid peroxidation are the production of four hydroxynonenal and acrolein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which have been shown to disrupt membrane asymmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and may be involved in the conformational changes to tau, promoting the formation of neurofibrillary tangles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>Oxidative damage occurs as part of the aging process, but it occurs at a much greater rate in most neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The hallmark of protein oxidation is the generation of protein carbonyls, which are markedly elevated in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is overwhelming evidence to implicate oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, and this is most likely an early event in the disease process. Less is known however of how the brain responds to oxidative insults. There are a number of cellular antioxidant defenses whose primary role is to convert the ROS into unreactive compounds. These defense mechanisms include superoxide dismutase, which works together with selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, catalase and more recently the peroxiredoxin family. These enzymes transform the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide<sub>,</sub> which in turn is converted to water. The distribution and changes in expression of the antioxidant enzymes have not been well studied as the other aspects of the disease process.</p>
      <p>Cellular selenium-dependant glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) has long been regarded as the major cellular antioxidant enzyme, but there are conflicting reports regarding the changes in activities of this enzyme in AD. Early reports suggest that there is no change in GPx-1 activities in AD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], while other researchers suggest that there is a decrease in GPx-1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There are no reports indicating compensatory increase in GPx-1 activity; however, cell models overexpressing GPx-1 are more resistant to A&#x3B2;-mediated toxicity, suggesting that increased levels of GPx-1 is protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>There is considerable evidence to implicate A&#x3B2; toxicity and the generation of ROS and in particular hydrogen peroxide as key steps in contributing to the neurotoxicity in AD. We have previously reported that peroxiredoxin 6, also termed 1 Cys-peroxiredoxin or nonselenium glutathione peroxidase, is upregulated in Parkinson&#x2019;s disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This enzyme has no amino acid homology to any known sequence of the glutathione peroxidase enzymes and has both antioxidant and phospholipase A2 activity and can reduce hydroxyperoxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Given that the brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to its high energy and oxygen requirements, high levels of transition metals and peroxidizable fatty acids suggests that peroxiredoxin 6 could play a key antioxidant role in neuroprotection.</p>
      <p>There are six members of the peroxiredoxin family at this stage with peroxiredoxins 1&#x2013;5 being the 2-Cys members while peroxiredoxin 6 is the sole 1-Cys member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. This enzyme is bifunctional with 80% of its function as a peroxidase and the remainder as a phospholipase A2. Peroxiredoxin 6 has not specifically been examined in brain tissue of AD patients, and the aims of this study are to examine the molecular forms, cellular distribution and association with AD pathology. This study focused on the cingulate, amygdala, hippocampus and cortical regions in six AD and six control brains.</p>

        <title>Colocalization of peroxiredoxin 6 and AD pathology</title>
        <p>The major defining pathology in AD is the presence of extracellular plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of tangles. Plaques are present in brain tissue at different stages of development, ranging from diffuse plaques to fibrillar and neuritic plaques. It is generally considered that diffuse plaques do not contain tau, but neuritic plaques contain both A&#x3B2; and tau.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Peroxiredoxin 6, also known as 1-Cys peroxiredoxin or non-selenium glutathione peroxidase, is a human brain antioxidant enzyme that is abundant in activated astrocytes and present in low levels in neurons. On exposure to hydrogen peroxide, the N-terminal peroxiredoxin 6 corresponding to Cys 47 is readily oxidized, but as yet its redox partner has not been identified. Glutathione, lipoic acid and cyclophilin have all been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition to its peroxidase activity, peroxiredoxin 6 also has phospholipase A2 activity that might be significant in the brain, which has a high lipid content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Peroxiredoxin 6 staining of astrocytes is markedly elevated in many brain regions in PD and dementia with Lewy bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We now show that it is upregulated in the astrocytes in AD and describe for the first time the range of molecular forms of peroxiredoxin 6 in human brain in both control and AD tissue.</p>
      <p>Three major variants and five minor forms were identified with pIs ranging from 5.3 to 6.1. There were three major differences in the peroxiredoxin 6 variants between control and AD tissue. The AD tissue had the two more acidic forms 1 and 2 that were not present in control tissue; the intensity of the major forms 6 and 7 were reversed between AD and control tissue and minor form 8 was absent in AD tissue. We can only speculate on the significance of these findings at this stage, but different forms may have different affinities for different substrates that might be more abundant under various pathological conditions or the more acidic forms are the result of oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At this stage, we cannot determine whether these differences are true isoforms or post-translational modifications of the same protein, but would suspect the latter. These findings are in agreement with two previous proteomic studies in an AD mouse model and in human brain AD tissue, which reported elevated levels of peroxiredoxin 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A more recent study using PC12-resistant and PC12 cells treated with A&#x3B2; also reported increased levels of peroxiredoxin 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A&#x3B2;-treated cells contained an extra acidic form, which was suggested to be the result of oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to a sulfenic, sulfinic or sulfonic derivative. We found two minor acidic forms in AD tissue, which is also consistent with this report.</p>
      <p>Tissue selection is also a variable that needs to be considered. While the AD tissue had all the hallmarks of AD pathology and was easy to define, age-matched control tissues are somewhat more variable. All the control tissue was from people without clinically defined AD, but most brains in this age group usually contain some neurodegenerative pathology. The age span of the two groups was similar, 59&#x2013;84&#xA0;years for the AD group and 61&#x2013;86&#xA0;years for the control group, but the mean age for the control group was 7&#xA0;years older. We feel confident that, although some control tissue may have had some elements of subclinical AD pathology, the reduced level of astrocyte activation and the clear differences in the cell counting would indicate that all the control tissues were not experiencing high levels of oxidative stress as compared to the AD tissue.</p>
      <p>Previously, we had shown that peroxiredoxin 6 was abundant in astrocytes in PD and dementia with Lewy body tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We have now used cellular markers to other brain cell types to show that in addition to astrocytes there is a low level in the cytoplasm of most neurons. Unlike astrocytes, neurons do not appear to have increased peroxiredoxin 6 staining in AD tissue. We could not detect any peroxiredoxin 6 staining in microglia or oligodendrocytes.</p>
      <p>Cell counting of peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes indicated that there was a marked increase in both the gray and white matter in AD tissue compared with control tissue. Gray matter had more peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes than white matter in both AD and control tissue, and this difference was more pronounced in AD tissue with <italic>F</italic> values of 89.0 and 14.5, respectively. Considering that the major pathology (plaques and tangles) is located in the gray matter, it would be expected that oxidative stress is more pronounced in this area. Cell counting indicated that the peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocyte numbers were elevated in all regions examined, suggesting that the insult activating astrocytes is wide spread and not confined to any specific region in either the gray or white matter. Indeed, extracellular plaques were observed in all regions examined in AD tissue. Although all regions examined showed astrocyte activation, this was not uniformly distributed through all areas, with some areas showing extensive astrocyte activation while adjacent areas were similar to controls.</p>
      <p>There are two defining pathologies in AD. These are the presence of extracellular plaques comprising abundant deposits of A&#x3B2; peptides, which later aggregate to form amyloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau aggregations in the form of paired helical filaments, which are termed tangles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The two well-described forms of plaques have been termed diffuse plaques and neuritic or senile plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], although other intermediate forms such as fibrillar plaques have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Diffuse plaques are spherical structures of less dense A&#x3B2; deposits and are considered an early stage of plaque formation. In diffuse plaques, aggregations of A&#x3B2; exists as nonamyloid deposits, but as the plaque progresses, the A&#x3B2; and other protein aggregations change from the normal conformation into a &#x3B2;-sheet structure, termed amyloid, and take up specific dyes like Congo red and thioflavin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These plaques do not generally contain tau; however, in many confocal images, diffuse plaques contain focal points of tau, which are probably enlarged neurites. Neuritic or senile plaques contain a dense core of amyloid enriched with A&#x3B2; peptide with a corona of less dense amyloid. The diffuse plaques appeared to elicit a stronger astrocytic response based on the level of peroxiredoxin 6 staining than the neuritic plaques. Our images suggest that once the A&#x3B2; forms amyloid and condenses, it is less stimulating toward astrocytes and perhaps the formation of amyloid is a protective mechanism to inactivate the toxicity of soluble A&#x3B2;. These observations are consistent with the findings of Kawaguchi-Niida et al., who reported that the highly reactive carbonyl crotonaldehyde generated during lipid peroxidation is localized to reactive astrocytes, microglia and diffuse plaques but undetectable in amyloid cores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although the activation of astrocytes and upregulation of peroxiredoxin 6 would be considered a protective response, in cell culture, soluble A&#x3B2; has been shown to stimulate nitric oxide synthetase and the production of nitric oxide, which is very damaging to neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This response is further upregulated by other inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1&#x3B2; and tumour necrosis factor-&#x3B1;, which are reported to be released from astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At this stage, we are not sure of the net benefit to neural tissue of activated astrocytes with elevated levels of peroxiredoxin 6, concomitant with the increased production of nitric oxide.</p>
      <p>Neurofibrillary tangles comprising hyperphosphorylated tau were observed in many regions in AD tissue. Two antibodies were used to localize tau, a monoclonal antibody (Novacastra) and one specific for paired helical filaments (Santa Cruz) and both produced a similar staining pattern. Neurons containing tau were not surrounded by activated astrocytes as were the diffuse plaques and to a lesser extent the neuritic plaques, suggesting that these cells are not secreting toxic or activating products that are stimulating to astrocytes. In PD, Lewy bodies contained a dense core of peroxiredoxin 6 staining suggesting that it was trying to detoxify oxidative stress produced by Lewy bodies, but we did not observe any interaction between tau and peroxiredoxin 6 in AD tissue. Although there is considerable evidence to implicate oxidative stress in the hyperphosphorylation of tau, this does not appear to upregulate peroxiredoxin 6 in tau positive neurons.</p>
      <p>In some regions, the walls of blood vessels exhibited strong peroxiredoxin 6 staining, which also elicited a strong astrocytic response in surrounding astrocytes. These activated astrocytes had many processes in contact with the endothelial cells. Although vascular amyloid deposits were seen in some sections and is a key feature of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the upregulation of peroxiredoxin 6 appeared to occur in regions without distinct A&#x3B2; staining. A&#x3B2; has been shown to induce vascular vasoconstriction in rat skin, which can be reversed by superoxide dismutase and catalase, indicating that A&#x3B2; is capable of generating ROS within blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The blood brain barrier consists of the capillary endothelial cells, and the foot processes of the astrocytes and the fused basal lamina of both cells. The peroxiredoxin 6 staining within the capillaries appears to be in the foot processes of the astrocytes. Whether this increased staining is due to ROS generated from within neural tissue or reflects a more systemic pathology derived from the circulation is unclear.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have shown for the first time the range of peroxiredoxin 6 variants, which are either isoforms or post-translational modifications in human brain tissue. We have also shown that peroxiredoxin 6 is primarily an astrocytic enzyme with very low levels in neurons and is not detectable in microglia or oligodendrocytes. This enzyme is markedly elevated in astrocytes in both white and gray matter in AD. Strongly staining peroxiredoxin 6 astrocytes appear to be involved in the detoxification of diffuse plaques and to a lesser extent in neuritic plaques, but is not associated with tau aggregations within neurons. From this work and previous work on PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, we suggest that peroxiredoxin 6 is a major antioxidant enzyme in human neural tissue.</p>
