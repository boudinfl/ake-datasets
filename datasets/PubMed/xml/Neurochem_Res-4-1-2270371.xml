      <abstract>
        <p>Limited information is available regarding the role of endogenous Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the spinal cord following transection injury. The present study investigated the possible role of GDNF in injured spinal cords following transection injury (T<sub>9</sub>&#x2013;T<sub>10</sub>) in adult rats. The locomotor function recovery of animals by the BBB (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan) scale score showed that hindlimb support and stepping function increased gradually from 7&#xA0;days post operation (dpo) to 21&#xA0;dpo. However, the locomotion function in the hindlimbs decreased effectively in GDNF-antibody treated rats. GDNF immunoreactivty in neurons in the ventral horn of the rostral stump was stained strongly at 3 and 7&#xA0;dpo, and in the caudal stump at 14&#xA0;dpo, while immunostaining in astrocytes was also seen at all time-points after transection injury. Western blot showed that the level of GDNF protein underwent a rapid decrease at 7&#xA0;dpo in both stumps, and was followed by a partial recovery at a later time-point, when compared with the sham-operated group. GDNF mRNA-positive signals were detected in neurons of the ventral horn, especially in lamina IX. No regenerative fibers from corticospinal tract can be seen in the caudal segment near the injury site using BDA tracing technique. No somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) could be recorded throughout the experimental period as well. These findings suggested that intrinsic GDNF in the spinal cord could play an essential role in neuroplasticity. The mechanism may be that GDNF is involved in the regulation of local circuitry in transected spinal cords of adult rats.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Spinal cord injury (SCI), a common result of car accidents, high-altitude falls and crashes, and other violent injuries is increasing yearly. It has been reported that there are about 15&#x2013;40 traumatic SCI cases per million persons annually population worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Once the spinal cord is damaged, it usually results in severe neurologic dysfunction and disability. Over the past several years, many extensive experiments have been done in order to find a way to promote the repair of the injured spinal cord. However, no good therapeutic approaches have yet been found. Recently, it has been shown that delivery of exogenous neurotrophic factors (NTFs) to the injured spinal cord has beneficial effects in improving functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], indicating the potential value of NTFs in the treatment of SCI.</p>
      <p>Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a distant member of the transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; (TGF-&#x3B2;) family, was originally purified using an assay based on its ability to maintain the survival and function of embryonic ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons in&#xA0;vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. GDNF supports neural survival in several neuronal populations, including midbrain dopamine neurons and motoneurons in the central nervous system. It promotes the survival and the differentiation of many peripheral neurons, such as sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Following injury, GDNF showed a benefit effect to rescue motoneurons degeneration after spinal root avulsion and distal nerve axotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], promotion of axonal regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and enhancing regeneration of dorsal roots (DR) into the adult rat spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, the transplantation of GDNF-producing cells greatly enhances the survival of spinal cord motorneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and regeneration of several spinal systems, including dorsal column sensory, and regionally projecting propriospinal pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] after SCI. The biological action of GDNF is mediated by a two-component receptor GFR&#x3B1;-1 and protein tyrosine kinase Ret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The GFR&#x3B1;-1 receptors expressed on a variety of neurons that project into the spinal cord, including supraspinal neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and local neurons. GDNF mRNAs are widely distributed in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal tissues of embryos and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although exogenous GDNF is available partially to promote propriospinal axonal regeneration and locomotion functional recovery, the role of intrinsic GDNF in injured spinal cords is largely unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the possible role of GDNF at various time intervals following spinal cord transection injury in adult rats, so as to gain insights into the contribution of endogenous GDNF in spinal neuroplasticity.</p>

        <title>Animal grouping and surgery</title>
        <p>Sixty-five adult Sprague-Dawley rats of either sex (weighing 200&#x2013;220&#xA0;g) were obtained from the Animal Experiment Center of Sichuan University of Medical Sciences. Fifty rats among all animals, designated as sham-operated group and spinal cord transection group that animals were allowed to survive 3, 7, 14 and 21&#xA0;days post operation (dpo), were used for immunohistochemistry and in&#xA0;situ hybridization (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;5 in each group), and Western blot analysis (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;5 in each group) respectively. Another five rats were intraperitoneally injected anti-GDNF solution (2.5&#xA0;ml/kg) once every 2&#xA0;days until 21&#xA0;dpo, designed as antibody neutralization group. Five animals, subjected to cord transaction, were injected with distilled water as the distilled water group. The last five operated rats were used to investigate corticospinal tract sprouting. Every effort was taken to reduce the number of animals and suffering during the experiments. All the experiments using animals were carried out according to the guidelines of the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animal. For the cord transection operation, the rats were anesthetized with 3.6% Chloral Hydrate (1&#xA0;ml/100&#xA0;g). A midline incision was made in the back, then the T<sub>7</sub>&#x2013;T<sub>8</sub> spinous processes and the vertebral laminae were removed to expose the spinal cord at T<sub>9</sub>&#x2013;T<sub>10</sub> level. The cord was transected between T<sub>9 </sub>and T<sub>10</sub> segments with a pair of microscissors. After surgery, the superficial back muscles and the skin were sutured along the midline.</p>

        <p>All rats in each group were evaluated using the BBB (Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan) scale score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The BBB score for evaluation of hindlimbs function after transected injury ranges from zero, which corresponds to flaccid paralysis, to 21, which is normal gait. Animals were allowed to walk around freely in a circular field (1.2&#xA0;m in diameter) for 4&#xA0;min while movements of the hindlimbs were closely observed. Ranking according to the scoring system described by Basso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] includes frequency and quality of hindlimb movement as well as forelimb/hindlimb coordination.</p>

        <p>The right peroneal nerve of the rats was dissected and a stimulation electrode was placed on it while a hole (3&#x2013;4&#xA0;mm in diameter) was made on the skull (2&#xA0;mm to the left of the midline and 2&#xA0;mm in front of the fonticulus posterior). An electrode was placed on the dura of brain cortex to record the SEP. The reference electrode was inserted at the nose epithelium. A ground electrode was inserted at the tail. The stimulus intensity was set high enough to produce a marked muscle twitch in the hind limb, about 1.1&#xA0;mA, the amplitude was 0.2&#xA0;ms and the frequency 3&#xA0;Hz. The SEP Tracings represented the average of 200 responses.</p>

        <p>After anesthesia with 3.6% Chloral Hydrate (1&#xA0;ml/100&#xA0;g), rats were perfused with 500&#xA0;ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5&#xA0;min and 500&#xA0;ml cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30&#xA0;min. The T<sub>9</sub> and T<sub>10</sub> spinal cord segments in the sham-operated group, and the cord stumps rostral and caudal to the injury site in the experimental group were harvested. This was followed by a postfix for 6&#x2013;12&#xA0;h, then immersed in 0.1&#xA0;M PBS containing 20% sucrose overnight. Sections of 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;m thickness were cut on a freezing microtome and used for freefloating GDNF immunostaining, then rinsed with 0.01&#xA0;M PBS and soaked in PBS containing 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30&#xA0;min at room temperature to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. They were immersed in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.3% TritonX-100 solution at room temperature for 2&#xA0;h, then incubated at 4&#xB0;C for 24&#xA0;h with anti-GDNF (1:1,000, Chemicon) rabbit polyclonal antibody. Sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1.5&#xA0;h at room temperature, and by reaction with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complexes (1:250, ABC Elite, Vector Labs). GDNF immunoreactivity was visualized with brown staining using diaminobenzidine (DAB) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>as substrate for 5&#xA0;min, and observed with a light microscope. Negative control experiments in which PBS was substituted for the primary antibody were performed to ascertain the specificity of antibody staining.</p>

        <p>Sections from sham-operated rats of 25&#xA0;&#x3BC;m thickness were also cut on a freezing microtome and used for in&#xA0;situ hybridization. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1&#xA0;M PBS, pH 7.2 (all treatments were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated), and further treated with 0.3% TritonX-100 solution for 10&#xA0;min and proteinase K (5&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml) at 37&#xB0;C for 25&#xA0;min, refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5&#xA0;min, repeatedly immersed in 0.1&#xA0;M PBS, then acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1&#xA0;M triethanolamine (pH 8.0) to prevent non-specific binding of the probes. The sections were washed with 2&#xD7; SSC (pH 7.0) and then prehybridized in a hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1&#xD7; Denhardt&#x2019;s solution, 0.2&#xA0;mg/ml Herring sperm DNA, and 10&#xA0;mM dithiothreitol) without probes at 37&#xB0;C for 2&#xA0;h before hybridization, then hybridized in 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;l hybridization solution containing 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;l probes at 37&#xB0;C for 12&#x2013;16&#xA0;h in a moist chamber. This was followed by washing in decreasing concentrations of SSC, from 4&#xD7; SSC (pH 7.0) at 37&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;min, 2&#xD7; SSC (pH 7.0) at 42&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;min, 1&#xD7; SSC (pH 7.0) at 48&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;min and ending with 0.5&#xD7; SSC (pH 7.0) at 50&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;min. Then sections were incubated at 37&#xB0;C in 1% blocking buffer (Roche) for 1&#xA0;h, subsequently reacted in 1:1,000 sheep anti-digoxygenin-alkaline phosphatase (AP) antibody in 1% blocking buffer at 4&#xB0;C overnight. Lastly, AP activity was detected using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) substrate (Roche).

The supernatant was obtained and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C for late use. Protein concentration was assayed with BCA reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). A 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;l aliquot of the samples was loaded on to each lane and electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) for 2.5&#xA0;h at a constant voltage of 120&#xA0;V. Proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane for 435&#xA0;min at 24&#xA0;V. The membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) with 10% non-fat dry milk overnight at 4&#xB0;C. The membrane was rinsed with PBST and incubated with the primary antibody for GDNF (1:1,000) at 4&#xB0;C. The membrane was incubated with a HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000; Vector Laboratories, CA) for 2&#xA0;h at room temperature. The membrane was developed in ECM kit and exposed against X-ray film in a darkroom. Densitometry analysis for the level of GDNF protein was performed by Bio-Gel Imagining system equipped with Genius synaptic gene tool software. &#x3B2;-actin (the primary antibody, 1:1,000, the secondary antibody, 1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as an internal control.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study, GDNF immunoreactive products in neurons from the gray matter and in astrocytes from the white matter of the spinal cord were observed in the sham-operation group. This indicates that GDNF could be involved in either the physiological function or the maintenance of survival for all kinds of neurons and astrocytes. It has been shown that GDNF mRNAs widely distributed in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal tissues of embryos and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, GDNF mRNA positive signals were found in the ventral horns, the field of nucleus dorsalis, and the dorsal horns in the spinal cords of adult rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and in the dorsal root ganglia in newborn rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, it raised the possibility that GDNF was synthesized by cells of the spinal cord and the GDNF expression may be changed after lesion, which implies that GDNF plays a potential role in both physiological and pathological conditions.</p>
      <p>Following cord transection, rats exhibited spinal cord dysfunction throughout the experimental period. There was an absence of SEP in surface recordings, indicating a loss of sensory function in the hindlimbs following transection injury. Comparatively, locomotion function recovery was observed from 7 to 21&#xA0;dpo, which was parallel to the improvement in BBB score. It showed that locomotor functional plasticity in the hindlimbs of rats did occur following SCI. As corticospinal tract regeneration was not seen in the caudal part near the injury site and scar tissues, it appears impossible to reestablish connectivity between the areas rostral and caudal of the injury site. The possible reason for locomotor function improvement may be related to the modulation of spinal circuit activity from endogenous neurotrophins. In the present study, BBB scores in the GDNF-antibody treated rats was inferior to that of the group not receiving the antibody treatment, indicating intrinsic GDNF may be available for improving locomotor function recovery to some extent in the hindlimbs of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It has been reported that GDNF can promote the repair or survival of spinal motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Several other studies have shown that the administration of GDNF could promote axonal regeneration, and enhance locomotion functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>GDNF immunoreactivity products in neurons from the ventral horn of the rostral stump were strongly stained at 3 and 7&#xA0;dpo, and in the caudal stump at 14&#xA0;dpo, suggesting that the GDNF expression in neurons was up-regulated following injury. This may be related to the locomotion functional recovery of hindlimbs. Glazner et&#xA0;al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] showed that strong labeling for GDNFR-&#x3B1; and c-ret mRNA was observed in large neurons from the ventral horn. Our results also supported the mRNA expression for GDNF in neurons of the ventral horn, as well as astrocytes in white matter using in&#xA0;situ hybridization. RET expression was unregulated following peripheral axotomy in alpha-motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and topical application of GDNF 30&#xA0;min after SCI significantly improved motor function and reduced blood&#x2013;spinal cord barrier (BSCB) breakdown, edema formation, and cell injury at 5&#xA0;h has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, GDNF is available to assist in locomotion functional plasticity by exerting behavioral and anatomic neuroprotection following SCI.</p>
      <p>In the present study, the expression patterns of endogenous GDNF indicated its possible role in maintaining motorneuron survival because GDNF mRNA-positive products were detected in neurons from the ventral horn by in&#xA0;situ hybridization. Of course, GDNF retrograde axonal transport from a target tissue to neuronal cell bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] is not absolutely excluded. It has been reported that GDNF produced by skeletal muscle is taken up at the nerve terminals and retrogradely transported to motoneurons of the ventral horn by axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>Comparing the results of immunostaining, the GDNF level varied throughout the spinal cord at 3&#xA0;dpo. In the caudal stump, GDNF showed a significant decrease. This was probably due to the transection injury that triggers a process destructive to ascending and descending tracts conduction and that extends tissue loss. Differently, a rapid up-regulation of GDNF was observed in the rostral stump. This suggested that GDNF had accumulated around the transection site due to interruption of its transport within the axons. Satake et&#xA0;al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] reported GDNF transcription began to increase within 30&#xA0;min after injury and peaked within 3&#xA0;h after spinal cord contusion injury. Interestingly, the level of GDNF protein reached its lowest point at 7&#xA0;dpo in both stumps, probably due to the consequences of cell death or apoptosis and/or interruption of the spinal cord pathways. Subsequently, GDNF protein levels gradually started to recover and surpassed the control level in the rostral stumps at 21&#xA0;dpo, which may be explained by (1) GDNF transport within axons was strengthened, (2) inflammation leads to the increase of GDNF synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and (3) induction of de novo synthesis of GDNF by neurons and/or non-neuronal cells.</p>
      <p>Noticeably, the GDNF positive cells in the white matter were labeled by GFAP simultaneously, which identified the labeled cells as astrocytes. Indeed, an association between reactive astrocytes and regenerating nerve fibers in the white matter of the central nervous system in&#xA0;vivo has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Also, increased GFR-1 in astrocytes of degenerating white matter in adult rat spinal cords after mechanical injury has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These results indicated that GDNF expression in astrocytes may be involved in neuroplasticity following spinal cord transection injury.</p>
      <p>The present study provides new evidence to understand the role of intrinsic GDNF in the rostral and caudal stumps of injured spinal cords. It suggests that GDNF plays an essential role in the neuroplasticity of the local circuitry, especially in the caudal stump of the transected spinal cords.</p>
