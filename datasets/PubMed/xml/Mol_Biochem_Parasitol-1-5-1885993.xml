      <abstract>
        <p>Bioinformatic analyses have been used to identify potential downstream targets of the essential enzyme <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl transferase in the TriTryp species, <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. These database searches predict &#x223C;60 putative <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins with high confidence, including both previously characterised and novel molecules. One of the latter is an <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated protein phosphatase which has high sequence similarity to the Protein Phosphatase with EF-Hand (PPEF) proteins identified in sensory cells of higher eukaryotes. In <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the PPEF-like phosphatases are encoded by single-copy genes and are constitutively expressed in all parasite life cycle stages. The N-terminus of LmPPEF is a substrate for <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl transferase and is also palmitoylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. The wild type protein has been localised to the endocytic system by immunofluorescence. The catalytic and fused C-terminal domains of the kinetoplastid and other eukaryotic PPEFs share high sequence similarity, but unlike their higher eukaryotic relatives, the C-terminal parasite EF-hand domains are degenerate and do not bind calcium.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critical processes in a variety of cellular mechanisms for the detection, transmission, and integration of intra- and extra-cellular signals. In eukaryotes, the extensively studied PPP family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases function in cellular processes as diverse as regulation of the cell-cycle, RNA splicing and T cell activation <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. PPPs have been divided into three subfamilies, commonly referred to as the &#x2018;Classical&#x2019; PPP phosphatases; PP1, PP2A and PP2B <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Novel phosphatases that cannot be categorised into these subfamilies include the retinal degeneration C protein (RdgC) from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. RdgC homologues are found in a number of eukaryotic species, including <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>
<xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref> but have not been identified in fungi, yeast or plants to date. These novel phosphatases, distinguished by several putative EF-hand motifs within a fused C-terminal domain, have subsequently been termed PPEFs or Protein Phosphatases with EF-Hands <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, PPEFs exhibit a much narrower tissue distribution than classical PPPs, being restricted to the central nervous system or primary sensory structures in all metazoans studied to date. Thus, Dm RdgC has been principally localised to photoreceptors and the mushroom bodies of the central brain <xref rid="bib2 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[2,5]</xref> while <italic>C. elegans</italic> CePPEF is highly enriched in primary sensory neurones <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation and immunostaining have also localised mammalian PPEF isoforms to sensory structures such as the inner ear, dorsal root ganglia, embryonic brainstem nuclei, photoreceptors and pinealocytes <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. These findings suggest that the PPEFs have conserved functions in diverse sensory systems and may have a role in development in mammals. The substrates of the RdgC/PPEF phosphatases, however, remain elusive.</p>
      <p>The domain architecture of RdgC/PPEF homologues is highly conserved, consisting of three fused domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). The N-terminal regulatory domain often contains myristoyl/palmitoyl acylation motifs and a downstream conserved IQ (isoleucine-glutamine) calmodulin binding domain. The catalytic domain contains several RdgC/PPEF specific sequences/motifs together with insertions of unknown function. The C-terminal domain contains at least two EF-hand motifs that have been shown to bind calcium in HsPPEF-1 and CePPEF <xref rid="bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref> and one or more degenerate EF-hand like motifs.</p>
      <p>Here, we describe the characterisation of PPEF-like genes in the diverse lower eukaryotes <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>, the sole members of this phosphatase family in these parasites. The kinetoplastid PPEFs were identified following a genome-wide search for <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins, carried out to identify downstream targets of the essential gene <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl transferase (NMT) in <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. We show that LmPPEF and TbPPEF are substrates for NMT <italic>in vivo</italic> and that LmPPEF (and probably TbPPEF) can also be palmitoylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using immunofluorescence, LmPPEF has been localised to the endocytic system of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, with some accumulation at the flagellar pocket. This location requires downstream regions of the protein in addition to the unique acylated N-terminus. Unlike other members of the RdgC/PPEF family, the EF-hand domains within the C-terminus of LmPPEF are degenerate and do not bind calcium under the experimental conditions used here.</p>

        <p>The 2862-bp <italic>LmPPEF</italic> open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from cosmid 1567.3 (gift from Al Ivens) using <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Promega) at 64&#xA0;&#xB0;C annealing temperature and the primers LmPPEF<sub>For</sub> (5&#x2032;-ATGGGGTGTGACTCATCCAAG-3&#x2032;) and LmPPEF<sub>Rev</sub> (5&#x2032;-TTAGCGACTAGTGCCGAGGC-3&#x2032;). The amplified <italic>LmPPEF</italic> ORF was cloned into pPCR-Script AMP SK(+) (Stratagene) to generate pLmPPEF.</p>
        <p>236-bp and 1056-bp fragments from the 3&#x2032; end of the <italic>LmPPEF</italic> ORF (nucleotides 2154&#x2013;2862 and 1806&#x2013;2862, respectively) were amplified at 60&#xA0;&#xB0;C annealing temperature using primers LmPPEF-Cterm1<sub>For</sub> (5&#x2032;-GACGATcatatgCGCATCTGGTAC-3&#x2032;) and LmPPEF-Cterm1<sub>Rev</sub> (-5&#x2032;-TGGCggatccTCTAGCCCTTA-3&#x2032;) or primers LmPPEF-Cterm2<sub>For</sub> (5&#x2032;-ATTAATTTcatatgCAGGTGGTGAGTCTA-3&#x2032;) and LmPPEF-Cterm2<sub>Rev</sub> (5&#x2032;-AATAggatccTTAGCGACTAGTGCC-3&#x2032;).

Cells were lysed for 1&#xA0;h at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C in lysis buffer (PBS containing 50&#xA0;mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150&#xA0;mM NaCl, 5&#xA0;mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml leupeptin, 500&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml pepstatin, 198&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml 1,10 phenanthroline and 25&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/ml E64). The lysates were pre-cleared by incubation for 1&#xA0;h at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C with protein A-coupled Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Labelled proteins were then recovered from the supernatant by incubation with either anti-LmPPEF or anti-GFP antibodies overnight at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C. After a second protein A-coupled Sepharose incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in lysis buffer and proteins removed by boiling in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer, prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. Detection of radiolabelling was improved using EN<sup>3</sup>HANCE&#x2122; Autoradiography Enhancer (Kodak). DTT was omitted from the loading buffer for separation of [9,10-<sup>3</sup>H] palmitate-labelled proteins.</p>

Catalysed by the enzyme myristoyl-CoA:protein <italic>N</italic>-myristoyltransferase (NMT), <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation often plays a role in targeting proteins to membrane locations and can additionally be involved in mediating protein&#x2013;protein interactions and stabilising protein structure. We have previously shown that NMT is essential for viability in kinetoplastid parasites <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> while myristate analogues (non-specific inhibitors of NMT) are lethal to <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes and bloodstream <italic>T. brucei</italic>
<xref rid="bib8 bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[8,16,17]</xref>. A range of more specific NMT inhibitory compounds has recently been tested and several shown to inhibit <italic>T. brucei</italic> NMT activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, with toxicity to bloodstream <italic>T. brucei</italic> at low &#x3BC;M concentrations <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, the cellular processes contributing to lethality in NMT-depleted cells are as yet unknown, although identification of the essential downstream targets of this enzyme may be crucial to the successful development of NMT as a potential drug target. Few kinetoplastid <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins have been studied in depth to date&#x2014;the <italic>Leishmania</italic> HASPB and SMP-1 proteins and the <italic>T. brucei</italic> ARL1 protein are exceptions <xref rid="bib11 bib14 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[11,14,19]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We used several strategies, all based on the well characterised eukaryotic <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation consensus motif, to search the <italic>L. major</italic>, <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genome datasets for putative <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins. The first publicly available prediction algorithm for these proteins, the PDOC00008 PROSITE myristoylation signature <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, is known to generate high numbers of false positive as well as false negative predictions. The more recent <italic>NMT Predictor</italic> program was developed using a set of &#x2018;positive&#x2019; amino acid sequences for profile training, substantially reducing the number of false results generated and extending the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation motif from 6 to 17 amino acids <xref rid="bib21 bib22" ref-type="bibr">[21,22]</xref>. Further refinement has come with the <italic>Myristoylator</italic> program, based on a neural network model and incorporating an additional &#x2018;negative&#x2019; training set of amino acids <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We firstly used the &#x2018;relaxed&#x2019; version of PROSITE PDOC00008 derived from the <italic>NMT Predictor</italic>, G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCNDEF]-{P} (described in <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>), to probe the kinetoplastid genome datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/">http://www.genedb.org/</ext-link>), thereby reducing the &gt;8000 predicted ORFs to &#x223C;250&#x2013;300 potentially <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins. The <italic>Myristoylator</italic> prediction algorithm was then applied to this refined data set, generating a final list of predicted <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins within high confidence boundaries (scores: 0.85&#x2013;1; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Tables S1&#x2013;S3, supplementary data</xref>). For the three genomes analysed, 62 <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins were predicted in <italic>L. major</italic>, 62 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and 123 in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, with the latter higher figure a consequence of the presence of two different haplotypes in the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> CL Brener genome sequence <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Predicted <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins contribute 0.5&#x2013;0.8% of the proteomes of other eukaryotes studied to date <xref rid="bib22 bib25" ref-type="bibr">[22,25]</xref>, and the kinetoplastid data fall well within this range (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Further analysis of the N-termini of the high confidence kinetoplastid proteins revealed a strong preference (&gt;70% of the total) for serine at position 6 in all three species, with threonine used in a further &#x223C;8% of proteins. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, serine or threonine in these positions allows stabilisation of the peptide&#x2013;NMT complex through hydrogen bonding with Asp417, Gly418 and His221 in the ScNMT crystal structure <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Of the putative <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins identified with high confidence, 8 were specific to <italic>L. major</italic>, including the dual acylated HASPB <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and the ADP-ribosylation factor LmARF3 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, with a similar number of targets specific to <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Tables S1&#x2013;S3, supplementary data</xref>). Other previously characterised <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins included the calpain-like proteins, <italic>T. brucei</italic> CAP 5.5 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and <italic>L. major</italic> SMP-1 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, while a number of putative signal transduction pathway proteins were also identified, including protein kinases and phosphatases (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the largest group of kinetoplastid <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins was that currently characterised as of &#x201C;unknown function&#x201D;. A majority of the proteins within this group are conserved between the three Tri-Tryp species.</p>

        <title>Kinetoplastid PPEF-like protein phosphatases</title>
        <p>Analyses of the kinetoplastid genomes have identified a range of kinases and protein phosphatases, some possessing novel motifs and insertions suggesting possible structural and functional differences from their mammalian homologues <xref rid="bib24 bib27" ref-type="bibr">[24,27]</xref>. Of the phosphatases, only a few of the classical types have been characterised to date: protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) from <italic>L. chagasi</italic>
<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, PP1 from <italic>T. cruzi</italic>
<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, PP1, PP2A and PP5 from <italic>T. brucei</italic>
<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The <italic>N</italic>-myristoylome analysis described above identified a conserved serine/threonine protein PPEF-like phosphatase (hereafter called PPEF) in all three kinetoplastid species: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="LmjF12.0660">LmjF12.0660</ext-link> in <italic>L. major</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Tb927.1.4050">Tb927.1.4050</ext-link> in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Tc00.1047053506529.380">Tc00.1047053506529.380</ext-link>/<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="Tc00.1047053510889.80">Tc00.1047053510889.80</ext-link> in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. These kinetoplastid PPEFs are of similar size and composition: 954&#xA0;aa, p<italic>I</italic> 8.0, 109.0&#xA0;kDa in <italic>L. major</italic>; 925&#xA0;aa, p<italic>I</italic> 7.7, 105.7&#xA0;kDa in <italic>T. brucei</italic>; 923&#xA0;aa, p<italic>I</italic> 7.7, 104.8&#xA0;kDa in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>.</p>
        <p>The phylogenetic relationship between these three proteins, the RdgC/PP5 family and the classical phosphatase groups was investigated by multiple sequence alignment (using CLUSTAL W <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>) and generation of an unrooted tree (using the Tree View software, version 1.5.2 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>). This analysis confirmed that the trypanosomatid PPEFs are more closely related to the RdgC/PPEF subfamily than to the classical PPP subfamilies, PP1, PP2A or PP2B, and are also separate from the PP5/PPT and PP7 subfamilies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Alignments revealed sequence similarity between the kinetoplastid PPEFs and other members of the RdgC/PPEF subfamily (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1, supplementary data</xref>), with the overall percentage of amino acid identity between representative proteins of this group shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B. While the kinetoplastid proteins share 60&#x2013;70% identity with each other, they are only &#x223C;20% conserved when compared to their higher eukaryotic relatives. The similarity between these proteins is more apparent, however, when comparing their domain organisation, both at the primary sequence level (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A; <xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2, supplementary data</xref>) and by homology modelling of the catalytic domain of LmPPEF with that of mammalian PP1 for which a high resolution structure is available <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1, supplementary data</xref>). The central catalytic domains of the kinetoplastid and mammalian PPEFs, together with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> RdgC, share significant sequence similarity (42%), including several RdgC/PP5 specific catalytic motifs <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Kinetoplastid PPEFs also share RdgC/PPEF specific mutations found in the conserved SAPNYC motif (common to all PPP phosphatases) that is found within the &#x3B2;12/&#x3B2;13 loop of the catalytic domain (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2, supplementary data</xref>). The first of these, a Pro to Ser substitution at position 3, is found in all members of the Rdg/PP5 family including the kinetoplastid proteins and at least two other protozoan phosphatases, PP1 from <italic>T. cruzi</italic>
<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and PfPPJ, a novel protein phosphatase from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>
<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The second substitution within the SAPNYC motif, replacement of the Cys-6 residue by either Tyr, Asp or Asn, is restricted to the RdgC/PPEF sub-family. Overall, the level of conservation within the catalytic domain of LmPPEF, including those residues acting as metal ligands, suggest that this protein and its kinetoplastid orthologues are functional phosphatases (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1, supplementary data</xref>).</p>
        <p>At their C-termini, the kinetoplastid PPEFs are more closely related to the C-termini of the RdgC/PPEFs than to any other calcium binding proteins or EF-hand domain-containing enzymes <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This observation supports the hypothesis that the catalytic domain of the ancestral form of RdgcC/PPEF fused with an EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein prior to the acquisition of the N-terminal domain <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. At their N-termini, there is little similarity between the kinetoplastid PPEFs and the RdgC/PPEFs except for the presence of putative <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs, which are found in some but not all members of the RdgC/PPEF phosphatase family.</p>

        <title>Genomic organisation and expression of the <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> PPEFs</title>
        <p>The Artemis annotation tool <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> was used to examine the level of gene synteny in the regions flanking the PPEF genes in the <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> genomes. LmPPEF is found on chromosome 12 in <italic>L. major</italic> while TbPPEF is found on chromosome 1 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/">http://www.genedb.org/</ext-link>). The chromosomal regions surrounding these genes have been analysed previously as part of a wider study, revealing high conservation of gene order <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus the kinetoplastid PPEFs, including TcPPEF, can be classified as true orthologues.</p>
        <p>To confirm the <italic>in silico</italic> gene analysis, genomic DNA blotting and hybridisation were used to show that both LmPPEF and TbPPEF are present as single copy genes in the <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> genomes, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and B). RNA expression from these genes in different parasite life cycle stages was initially demonstrated using RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>Ci and Di). RNA blotting and hybridisation were then used to confirm constitutive expression of single PPEF transcripts (of 4.3 and 4.8&#xA0;kb, respectively) in insect and mammalian stages of <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>Cii and Dii).</p>
        <p>Expression of the LmPPEF protein was analysed by immunoblotting, using affinity-purified antibodies raised against the C-terminal 236 residues of the recombinant protein (expressed from construct LmPPEF-Cterm1, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). These antibodies recognised a single polypeptide band of 109&#xA0;kDa on immunoblots of whole <italic>L. major</italic> parasite lysates, correlating with the size of the deduced open reading frame of gene <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="LmjF12.0660">LmjF12.0660</ext-link> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Whole cell lysates from <italic>L. major</italic> procyclics, metacyclics and amastigotes were then analysed and a single 109&#xA0;kDa protein detected in all three life cycle stages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). However, no signal was detected in <italic>T. brucei</italic> procyclic or bloodstream form parasite lysates using the same anti-LmPPEF (data not shown). This suggests that this C-terminal antibody does not cross react with TbPPEF (despite the 51% amino acid conservation in this domain) and/or that TbPPEF is expressed at low levels during the parasite life cycle.</p>

        <title>LmPPEF is not a calcium-binding protein</title>
        <p>Given the degeneracy of EF-hand motifs in the C-terminal domains of the kinetoplastid PPEFs, and the absence of N-terminal IQ calmodulin binding motifs, we investigated whether LmPPEF can bind calcium, either as a recombinant or wild type protein, in a mobility shift assay. In this analysis, target and control proteins were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing gels in the presence of either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or EGTA. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A shows the positive (calreticulin) and negative (BSA) control proteins after separation: the migration of BSA was similar in both gel types whereas the migration of calreticulin was significantly altered on electrophoresis through Ca<sup>2+</sup> as compared to EGTA, with &gt;50% showing a mobility shift. To analyse the behaviour of LmPPEF in this assay, the C-terminal 351 residues, containing all three EF-hand like motifs, were expressed (from construct LmPPEF-Cterm 2) as a 40&#xA0;kDa N-terminally His-tagged protein in <italic>L. major</italic>. Comparing the mobility of this protein and wild type LmPPEF in whole cell lysates, in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or EGTA, revealed no significant differences in migration, suggesting that LmPPEF does not bind calcium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Cell fractionation of total <italic>L. major</italic> proteins was also carried out, to analyse the relative distribution of LmPPEF between membrane and cytoplasm and to investigate whether this distribution was altered in the presence or absence of calcium. Wild type parasites were lysed in either PBS alone, PBS plus 1&#xA0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or PBS plus 1&#xA0;mM EGTA and separated by electrophoresis. Cell fractionation carried out in PBS alone revealed that LmPPEF is predominantly membrane-associated, with &#x223C;20% of the protein detected in the soluble or cytoplasmic fraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). The presence or absence of calcium did not alter this membrane versus cytoplasmic distribution, again suggesting that the degenerate EF-hands in LmPPEF are unlikely to bind calcium. A similar conclusion emerged from <sup>45</sup>Ca overlay experiments with both wild type and recombinant protein (data not shown).</p>

        <title>The N-termini of recombinant and wild type kinetoplastid PPEFs are substrates for acylation in vivo</title>
        <p>Given the presence of <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation motifs together with cysteine residues predicted to be palmitoylation sites at the N-termini of kinetoplastid PPEFs (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="sec">Tables S1&#x2013;S3, supplementary data</xref>), we firstly confirmed that these proteins could act as templates for NMT in an <italic>E. coli</italic> co-expression assay <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In these experiments, plasmids expressing NMT and TbPPEF as substrate were co-expressed in the presence of [<sup>3</sup>H]-myristoyl CoA and incorporation of radioactivity into myristoylated product detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). Using NMTs from both <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> with TbPPEF, these results demonstrate radiolabelling of a &#x223C;106&#xA0;kDa product in the presence of each enzyme, indicative of the transfer of myristate to TbPPEF (as previously demonstrated for HASPA and TbARL1) <xref rid="bib8 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[8,14]</xref>. While the amount of radiolabelled product appears greater with LmNMT rather than TbNMT in this experiment, this is likely due to an artefact of loading (as indicated by the higher amount of NMT-myristoyl CoA binary complex loaded on to the gel) rather than substrate specificity.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate acylation in parasites <italic>in vivo</italic>, metabolic labelling experiments were carried out with <italic>L. major</italic> transgenic lines expressing the first 37 N-terminal residues of PPEF fused with GFP (Lm37WT-GFP, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Bii) or a mutated version, in which the Gly in position 2, essential for <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation, is substituted with Ala (Lm37G2A-GFP, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Bii). These parasites express equivalent amounts of the two fusion proteins, as indicated by immunoblotting with anti-GFP and anti-NMT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). Following radiolabelling with [<sup>3</sup>H]-myristate or [<sup>3</sup>H]-palmitate, the fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. This analysis detected a [<sup>3</sup>H]-myristate-labelled protein of 35&#xA0;kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of the Lm37WT-GFP protein, which was absent from parasites expressing Lm37G2A-GFP lacking the residue required for <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C). Similarly, autoradiography of parasites labelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-palmitate revealed a single radiolabelled protein of the same molecular mass, corresponding to [<sup>3</sup>H]-palmitate-labelled Lm37WT-GFP. This protein was again absent in parasites expressing Lm37G2A-GFP. These data correlate with similar experiments with the dual acylated HASPB protein, in which loss of the residue required for <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation also prevented palmitoylation, due to mislocalisation of the protein within the cell <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The experiments in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A and C confirm that TbPPEF and LmPPEF can be acylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, both in a heterologous cell system and in live parasites. To confirm that endogenous LmPPEF is <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, anti-LmPPEF was used in immunoprecipitations from parasite lysates following metabolic labelling with [<sup>3</sup>H]-myristate. As shown by autoradiography in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D, a radiolabelled protein of &#x223C;109&#xA0;kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of LmPPEF, was detected in the lysate from wild type <italic>L. major</italic> parasites, while no proteins were detected following precipitation with protein A beads alone. Radiolabelled parasites expressing LmPPEF-TAP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>Bi) were also subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-LmPPEF, generating two detectable [<sup>3</sup>H]-myristate-labelled proteins in the lysate: the smaller corresponding to the 109&#xA0;kDa native LmPPEF and the larger weaker &#x223C;129&#xA0;kDa band corresponding to the predicted size of the LmPPEF-TAP fusion protein.</p>

        <title>LmPPEF is localised to the endomembrane system of <italic>L. major</italic></title>
        <p>Immunofluorescence microscopy with the affinity-purified LmPPEF antibody was used to investigate the location of LmPPEF in procyclic <italic>L. major</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). Overlay of the fluorescent signal with DAPI (for identification of the nucleus and kinetoplast) indicated a punctate distribution of signal within the cytosol, reminiscent of the endocytic system, together with some concentration in the region of the flagellar pocket. These observations are consistent with the predominantly membrane association of LmPPEF revealed by cellular fractionation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Counter-staining with anti-LCB2, which recognises an ER-resident sub-unit of serine palmitoyltransferase <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> showed no overlap with PPEF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B) while labelling with the endocytic lipophilic tracer, FM4-64, demonstrated some co-localisation with the flagellar pocket and endosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). PPEF staining was excluded from the nucleus, plasma membrane and flagellum.</p>
        <p>We attempted to express and analyse GFP-fusions with either full-length wild type LmPPEF or the N-terminal 473 residues alone (lacking the C-terminal EF-hands). However, these constructs did not express after transfection into <italic>L. major</italic>, probably due to the large sizes of the recombinant proteins generated. As an alternative approach, given that the N-terminus of LmPPEF is a target for acylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), the N-terminal GFP transgenic parasite lines (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) were used to investigate the role of these modifications in intracellular localisation of the fusion proteins. Counter-staining with FM4-64 was also utilized to detect the flagellar pocket in these analyses. Transfected parasites expressing the first 37 residues of LmPPEF fused to GFP (Lm37WT-GFP) targeted the fusion protein predominantly to the flagellum and the flagellar pocket, with weak staining only in the cell body (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D). Loss of the <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation site by mutation of Gly to Ala (Lm37G2A-GFP) resulted in homogeneous distribution of cytosolic fluorescence throughout the parasite (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>E), in a pattern almost identical to the localisation of GFP alone (data not shown). Separate mutation of the putative palmitoylation site alone, by substituting Cys-3 with Ser (Lm37C3S-GFP), resulted in concentrated signal in a region adjacent to the flagellar pocket most likely to be the Golgi (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>F). Expression of the double mutant Lm37G2A, C3S-GFP, lacking both acylation sites, caused the fusion protein to remain localised within the cytosol (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>G). These observations correlate with those previously observed using similar N-terminal mutations of the <italic>L. major</italic> HASPB protein <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, suggesting that the wild type fusion protein (Lm37WT-GFP) requires <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation in the cytosol to reach the Golgi region, where palmitoylation further modifies the protein for trafficking to other locations, predominantly the flagellum. Clearly, the localisations of these GFP fusion proteins are distinct from the endocytic location of wild type LmPPEF, indicating that other regions and/or signals within this large protein are important for subcellular localisation. More generally, these data suggest that N-terminal dual acylation might act as a primary signal in targeting proteins to the flagellum in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, as exemplified by HASPB, SMP-1 and PPEF <xref rid="bib11 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[11,19 and this study]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this paper, as part of a wider study of the downstream targets of NMT, we describe the PPEF-like protein phosphatases that are encoded by single copy genes in three kinetoplastid species. These phosphatases were identified following <italic>in silico</italic> genome analysis that predicted a subset of kinetoplastid proteins as &#x201C;high confidence&#x201D; substrates for NMT. Within this subset were several proteins already confirmed as <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated in <italic>L. major</italic> or <italic>T. brucei</italic>, together with a number of species-specific molecules and a larger group of proteins found in all three species, many of no known function. We predict that all of these &#x201C;high confidence&#x201D; putative substrates are acylated <italic>in vivo</italic> but do not exclude other &#x201C;medium confidence&#x201D; proteins as candidates for NMT modification.</p>
      <p>LmPPEF and TbPPEF, studied in detail here, are constitutively expressed, membrane-associated acylated proteins. LmPPEF is found in the endocytic system and the flagellar pocket. Conservation of key features and residues within the catalytic domains, which have been modelled against the mammalian PP1 catalytic region, suggest that these proteins are active enzymes (although this has not yet been demonstrated biochemically). Unlike these conserved central regions, however, divergence in the N- and C-terminal domains has led to loss of the IQ calmodulin binding motif and degeneration of the EF-hands, features that characterise the higher eukaryotic PPEFs <xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">[39,40]</xref>. Thus, there is no evidence that the kinetoplastid proteins are regulated by cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and/or calmodulin, in contrast to the demonstrated interactions of both human PPEF and <italic>Drosophila</italic> RdgC with these regulators <xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">[39,40]</xref>. The analysis in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> would support this conclusion.</p>
      <p>Although PPEF-like proteins have been characterised in a number of species, the functions of these unusual phosphatases are not well understood. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> RdgC protein is implicated in dephosphorylation of rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that initiates vertebrate and invertebrate phototransduction. However, mutant mice with targeted disruptions in each of their two PPEF genes show no retinal degeneration and normal rhodopsin dephosphorylation kinetics, suggesting interspecies functional differences despite high similarities in protein sequence <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Completion of the Tri-Tryp genome projects has confirmed earlier predictions that these parasites have &#x2018;stream-lined&#x2019; signal transduction mechanisms as compared to their higher eukaryotic multicellular counterparts <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The lack of several classes of signalling molecules, including serpentine receptors, heterotrimeric G proteins and most classes of catalytic receptors, contrasts with the presence of a large and diverse family of kinase and phosphatases, suggesting complex cellular interactions <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. While the conservation and expression of PPEF genes in the Kinetoplastida strongly suggest a functional role for these unusual phosphatases, it is clear that this is unlikely to be similar to that demonstrated for the RdgC protein. We have perturbed <italic>TbPPEF</italic> expression by inducible RNAi in both bloodstream and procyclic stages of <italic>T. brucei</italic>, which results in a partial growth defect under normal culture conditions (data not shown). However, it cannot be discounted in these experiments that a more extreme phenotype is masked by sufficient residual expression to support enzyme activity. Functional analysis of conditional gene deletion mutants will be required, together with substrate identification, to delineate roles for the kinetoplastid PPEFs in parasite viability.</p>
