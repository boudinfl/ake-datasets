      <abstract>
        <p>The ability to genetically manipulate mice has led to rapid progress in our understanding of the roles of different gene products in human disease. Transgenic mice have often been created in the FVB/NJ (FVB) strain due to its high fecundity, while gene-targeted mice have been developed in the 129/SvJ-C57Bl/6J strains due to the capacity of 129/SvJ embryonic stem cells to facilitate germline transmission. Gene-targeted mice are commonly backcrossed into the C57Bl/6J (B6) background for comparison with existing data. Genetic modifiers have been shown to modulate mammary tumor latency in mouse models of breast cancer and it is commonly known that the FVB strain is susceptible to mammary tumors while the B6 strain is more resistant. Since gene-targeted mice in the B6 background are frequently bred into the polyomavirus middle T (PyMT) mouse model of breast cancer in the FVB strain, we have sought to understand the impact of the different genetic backgrounds on the resulting phenotype. We bred mice deficient in the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) until they were congenic in the PyMT model in the FVB and B6 strains. Our results reveal that the large difference in mean tumor latencies in the two backgrounds of 53 and 92&#xA0;days respectively affect the ability to discern smaller differences in latency due to the Nos2 genetic mutation. Furthermore, the longer latency in the B6 strain enables a more detailed analysis of tumor formation indicating that individual tumor development is not stoichastic, but is initiated in the #1 glands and proceeds in early and late phases. NO production affects tumors that develop early suggesting an association of iNOS-induced NO with a more aggressive tumor phenotype, consistent with human clinical data positively correlating iNOS expression with breast cancer progression. An examination of lung metastases, which are significantly reduced in PyMT/iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice compared with PyMT/iNOS<sup>+/+</sup> mice only in the B6 background, is concordant with these findings. Our data suggest that PyMT in the B6 background provides a useful model for the study of inflammation-induced breast cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Transgenic mouse models that develop spontaneous mammary adenocarcinomas have proven valuable in revealing molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and metastasis (Cardiff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>; Fargiano et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2003</xref>). Models target specific pathways depending on the transgene being expressed under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR) or whey acid protein (WAP) mammary gland promoters and thereby replicate genetic defects in subsets of human tumors (Cardiff and Wellings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1999</xref>; Rosner et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). Molecules from pathways known to be important in the pathogenesis of human breast cancer such as the Wnt, Ras and ErbB2/Neu pathways have been utilized, however few spontaneous mammary tumor model systems develop metastasis, a crucial aspect of cancer progression.</p>
      <p>As demonstrated by gene expression analysis (Ma et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>), the polyomavirus middle T (PyMT) model in the FVB/N (FVB) background activates the same signaling pathways as erbB2, an oncogene amplified or overexpressed in approximately 30% of human breast cancers. The model has been particularly useful for genetic studies due to its short tumor latency and high incidence of pulmonary metastasis (Guy et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1992</xref>). These features have enabled global expression profiling of PyMT tumors from different genetic backgrounds to identify signatures of tumor virulence (Qiu et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2004</xref>) that are consistent with a gene set predictive of metastasis in human tumors (Ramaswamy et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2003</xref>). Hence, the model has been used effectively to dissect early and late stages of mammary tumor development (Guy et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1994</xref>; Lin et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2001</xref>; Webster et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1998</xref>; Williams et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). In women with breast cancers involving this pathway, the course of the disease varies widely. One powerful means to understand that variability is to identify useful animal models. The PyMT breast cancer model can be used in genetic crossing experiments to identify loci having modifier effects on either tumorigenesis or metastasis (Le Voyer et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). An understanding of the genetic polymorphisms underlying these effects is important in the study of human cancer as genetic variability affects host-tumor interactions in numerous ways and is an important factor in the response to therapy.</p>
      <p>Widely varied tumor responses to polyoma virus infection among different inbred strains of mice have been well documented (Freund et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1992</xref>; Gross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1983</xref>). Much of this difference can be attributed to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which results in immunologically mediated resistance associated with an H-2<sup>b</sup> haplotype such as in C57Bl strains (Law et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1967</xref>; Ting and Law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1965</xref>). Other inbred strains, notably those with the H-2<sup>d</sup> and H-2<sup>k</sup> haplotypes have moderate and weak tumor resistance respectively (Freund et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1992</xref>). The FVB strain has an H-2<sup>q</sup> haplotype, which may be an additional MHC locus that confers susceptibility to polyoma virus induced tumorigenesis. Alternatively, non-MHC genes can also result in a dominant pattern of tumor susceptibility as in the case of the C3H/BiDa strain (Freund et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1992</xref>).</p>
      <p>Strain variations are also relevant to the study of genetic mutations in mouse models of disease. An analysis of targeted disruptions on mammary tumorigenesis in the PyMT model requires breeding of knockout models usually developed in the 129/SvJ-C57Bl/6J background into the FVB background. It is commonly recognized that the FVB strain is susceptible while the C57Bl/6J (B6) strain is more resistant to PyMT mammary tumorigenesis and F1 crosses of these strains increase tumor latency by approximately 6&#xA0;days (Lifsted et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). However, it is not clear what effects continued backcrossing has on the analysis of targeted mutations in the PyMT model.</p>
      <p>Previously we reported that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) deficiency in the PyMT model in the B6 background resulted in an increase in tumor latency that was not observed in the FVB background (Ellies et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>). Since the issue of strain background is an important one for analysis of mouse models we have made iNOS knockout mice congenic in the FVB and B6 backgrounds and carried out a comparison of tumorigenesis and metastasis in both strains.</p>

        <p>PyMT (FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/J) mice (Guy et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1992</xref>) were obtained from W. Muller (McMaster University, Ontario, Canada). We acquired PyMT mice that had been backcrossed 5 generations into the B6 background from A. Varki (UCSD, La Jolla, CA). Control (C57Bl/6J) and iNOS deficient mice (B6.129P2-<italic>Nos2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Lau</italic></sup>/J; Laubach et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1995</xref>) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. The PyMT B6 mice were further backcrossed until congenic in the B6 background and then bred with iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were bred into the FVB background until congenic (&gt;10 generations) and then crossed with PyMT FVB mice. Female mice heterozygous for the PyMT transgene and homozygous for the wild type or mutated iNOS gene were used in these studies. For clarity and brevity, we have designated FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/JxB6.129P2-<italic>Nos2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Lau</italic></sup>/J<sup>+/+</sup> mice PyMT/iNOS<sup>+/+</sup> and FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/JxB6.129P2-<italic>Nos2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Lau</italic></sup>/J<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice PyMT/iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>. FVB mice were palpated twice weekly from 4&#xA0;weeks of age and B6 mice once weekly from 8&#xA0;weeks of age to monitor mammary tumor development. Tumors were measured in 2 dimensions using calipers and tumor volume estimated using the standard calculation for a sphere 4/3&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;3.14&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;a&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;b<sup>2</sup> where a is the smaller diameter and b is the larger diameter. After euthanizing the mice, mammary tumors were dissected and weighed and the total tumor burden calculated (tumor weight/body weight). All studies followed the NIH guidelines for the care and treatment of experimental laboratory rodents.</p>

        <title>PyMT tumorigenesis is delayed in the C57Bl/6 strain</title>
        <p>The PyMT model was originally developed in the FVB strain due to its high fecundity. Tumor growth occurs rapidly and metastatic tumors form in the lungs (Guy et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1992</xref>). To compare tumorigenesis in the FVB strain with that in the C57Bl/6 strain onto which many genetically modified strains are bred, we made PyMT mice congenic in the B6 background. Examination of tumor latency showed a dramatic difference with a mean latency of 53&#xA0;days for PyMT tumor development in FVB mice and 92&#xA0;days in B6 mice, a delay of approximately 6&#xA0;weeks (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Whole mounts of mammary glands from the two strains also showed that even at weaning, hyperplasias were more advanced in FVB than B6 PyMT mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).

        <p>To determine how this difference in tumor latency may affect the phenotype observed following crossbreeding with genetically altered mice, we bred in iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice congenic in the two backgrounds. As previously reported, we observed a 3&#x2013;4&#xA0;week delay in palpable tumors in B6 PyMT mice lacking iNOS activity (Ellies et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>). However, this difference was difficult to discern in the FVB background due to the rapid tumor onset (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Mammary gland whole mounts reflected the latency data with a clear difference in tumor growth with iNOS deficiency being observed in the #4 glands of B6 PyMT mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A).

        <title>PyMT tumor growth kinetics vary in FVB/N and C57Bl/6 strains </title>
        <p>The pattern of tumor growth differed between strains and may in part account for the greater disparity in tumor development observed in the absence of iNOS in PyMT B6 mice. Once the mean tumor volume reached 1&#xA0;cm<sup>3</sup>, tumor growth proceeded exponentially in the PyMT FVB mice leading to sacrifice within 3&#xA0;weeks (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). To achieve the same final tumor volume, the PyMT B6 mice required approximately 7&#xA0;weeks and growth followed a more linear pattern, suggesting more variable rates of growth of individual tumors. Indeed, when we analyzed the tumor latency of all tumors, we were able to define two distinct phases of tumor growth in the B6 strain: early, from 12&#x2013;17&#xA0;weeks and late, from 19&#x2013;23&#xA0;weeks (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). The major effect of iNOS deficiency appears to be a delay in the early phase of tumor development.

        <p>In concordance with increased tumor latency and decreased tumor growth (Ellies et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>) tumor burden was significantly lower in PyMT/iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A).

Although there was a slight reduction in the mean MVD in #1 versus #2&#x2013;5 tumors in the PyMT/iNOS<sup>+/+</sup> and PyMT/iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> genotypes, it was not statistically significant, suggesting this is not the mechanism for the difference observed in tumor growth at different locations (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

        <p>This site-specific effect prompted us to examine tumor latency in individual glands. We had observed during palpations that the #1 mammary gland was usually the first to develop tumors, however we were surprised to find a clear difference between the latency of the #1 tumors compared with all other tumors (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This difference was more noticeable in the absence of iNOS. The greater difference in mean latency in the #4 glands compared with the #1 glands was consistent with the tumor burden results being more significant in the #4 glands.

        <p>The PyMT model has been useful for the study of tumor metastasis due to the high penetrance of this clinically important characteristic of tumor progression.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis have provided important insights into the molecular basis of human breast cancer and are essential for gathering preclinical data regarding therapeutic drug efficacy. The PyMT model in the FVB strain has a mean tumor latency of 53&#xA0;days and has been used extensively in studies of mammary tumorigenesis (Cardiff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>; Muller and Neville <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2001</xref>). The model is frequently crossed with gene-targeted strains that have been generated in the B6/129 mixed background or backcrossed onto the B6 background. We had highly variable results examining iNOS effects in a mixed B6/FVB PyMT background and sought to characterize the phenotype of this mutation in congenic FVB and B6 strains. Our study demonstrates that the genetic background of the PyMT model can affect the ability to discern differences in phenotype due to genetic alterations that require time to influence tumor progression. Differences observed in the B6 background were obscured in the FVB background due to the signficantly shorter tumor latency and more rapid tumor growth in this strain.</p>
      <p>Further analysis of mammary tumorigenesis in the B6 background indicated that tumor formation occurred in 2 phases: early, from 12&#x2013;17&#xA0;weeks and late, from 19&#x2013;23&#xA0;weeks. It is the early phase of tumor formation that is most affected in the absence of iNOS, consistent with recent data linking iNOS expression with transcriptional upregulation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) by nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Lo et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). EGFR/ErbB1, a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that signal via the same pathways as PyMT (Webster et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1998</xref>), is also found in the nucleus of highly proliferative cells where is functions as a transcription factor (Marti et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1991</xref>; Wells and Marti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2002</xref>). Structural and functional characterization of the iNOS promoter has identified binding elements for both EGFR and STAT3 (Lo et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). Immunohistochemical studies of breast carcinomas show that nuclear EGFR positively correlates with iNOS and survival analysis demonstrates that high levels of iNOS are a prognostic indicator of poor survival (Lo et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). Thus the B6 PyMT mice in the presence or absence of iNOS deficiency are likely to provide an important model for further analysis of these novel molecular interactions.</p>
      <p>Mammary tumor latency for each of the ten murine mammary glands has generally been assumed to be stoichiometric. However our data demonstrate that the #1 mammary glands have tumor initiating properties that are distinct from the other 4 pairs of mammary glands. The #1 mammary glands have the smallest fat pads and are located in the head and neck region, which is highly vascular, so we hypothesized that an increase in vascular density in the #1 tumors could be responsible for this difference. An examination of the microvacular density (MVD) of #1 tumors versus all others showed a trend in which #1 tumors had a higher mean MVD than #2&#x2013;5 tumors as determined by quantitative analysis of CD31 staining. However, these values were not statistically significant, suggesting a different mechanism is responsible for the observed site-specific differences in tumor burden and tumor latency. Other factors in the stromal microevironment may also play a role in mediating this effect. The release of epidermal growth factor (EGF) from the submandibular salivary gland has been shown to promote mouse mammary tumorigenesis in virus mediated and chemical carcinogen induced models (Kurachi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1985</xref>; Molinolo et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>). The proximity of the #1 glands to the submandibular gland make EGF induced proliferation a plausible explanation, however further investigations will be required to determine whether the release of this growth factor primarily affects the #1 glands.</p>
      <p>Another possible explanation for this intriguing difference is that the #1 mammary gland is developmentally distinct from the other mammary glands. The #1 gland is not the first to develop since placode 3 develops first at E11.0&#x2013;11.5 on the ectodermal streak between the forelimb and hindlimb (Eblaghie et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>; Mailleux et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>). Placodes 1 and 5 arise from the axillary and inguinal streaks respectively and placodes 4 and 2 form where the mammary line abuts these streaks (Veltmaat et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). Recent studies indicate that signaling molecules essential for mammogenesis are placode dependent. Placodes 2 and 3 do not form in the absence of Lef1 mediated canonical Wnt signaling (Boras-Granic et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>) and placodes 1, 2, 3 and 5 require Fgf10 signaling from somites underlying the ectoderm (Mailleux et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>; Veltmaat et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>). It is clear there are developmental differences between mammary glands and it is possible that early developmental factors result in an increased propensity for malignant transformation in the #1 mammary glands, though the identity of these factors remains to be determined.</p>
      <p>Since metastasis is an aspect of tumor progression that is critical to patient survival, we examined the effect of iNOS on tumor metastasis in both the FVB and B6 backgrounds. No significant difference in metastatic burden was found in PyMT/iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice in the FVB background, however the tumor burden was reduced in lungs of PyMT/iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice in the B6 background compared with controls. Furthermore, the reduction in metastatic burden was not due simply to the delayed tumor latency as we maintained PyMT/iNOS<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice longer to compensate for the difference and found that this did not alter our previous findings (Ellies et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Human clinical studies have associated increased iNOS expression with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (Loibl et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>), and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with a 22&#x2013;39% reduction in the risk of breast cancer (Harris et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>; Khuder and Mutgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2001</xref>). To increase our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in these effects, it is essential to have animal models that recapitulate the clinical findings. We have shown that in the PyMT B6 background loss of iNOS, an important inflammatory mediator, results in increased tumor latency and decreased tumor metastasis that is not due simply to the difference in latency. This model will be useful in determining molecular pathways underlying the role of iNOS in breast cancer.</p>
