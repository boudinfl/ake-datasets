      <abstract>
        <p>The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein is a key mediator of the central tolerance for tissue specific antigens and is involved in transcriptional control of many antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTEC). Mutations in the <italic>AIRE</italic> gene cause a rare disease named autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). Here we report using GST pull-down assay, mass-spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation that a heterotrimeric complex of DNA-Dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PK), consisting of Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is a novel interaction partner for AIRE. <italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays show that the residues Thr68 and Ser156 are DNA-PK phosphorylation sites in AIRE. In addition, we demonstrate that DNA-PKcs is expressed in AIRE positive mTEC cell population and that introduction of mutations into the AIRE phosphorylation sites decrease the capacity of AIRE to activate transcription from reporter promoters. In conclusion, our results suggest that phosphorylation of the AIRE protein at Thr68 and Ser156 by DNA-PK influences AIRE transactivation ability and might have impact on other aspects of the functional regulation of the AIRE protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>AIRE</italic> (autoimmune regulator) is a defective gene in APECED (autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy, OMIM #240300), the genetic autoimmune disease, which manifests as autoimmunity to multiple endocrine glands. In human tissues, AIRE is expressed in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x2013;3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The AIRE protein (57.5&#xA0;kDa) has several features which indicate that it might function in transcriptional regulation. AIRE shares similar domain architecture with the Sp100 family proteins (Sp140, Sp110 and Sp100C), which all have HSR (for homogenously staining region), SAND (for Sp100, AIRE-1, NucP41/75 and DEAF-1) and PHD (for plant homeodomain) domains. HSR is central for AIRE di- or oligomerization <xref rid="bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. The SAND domain is a DNA binding domain found in several mammalian nuclear proteins. NMR spectroscopy studies of the Sp100B SAND domain have shown that a conserved amino acid motif KDWK is essential for DNA recognition <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although AIRE lacks the KDWK motif, its SAND domain has also been shown to bind DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The PHD fingers are found in nuclear proteins that are often involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation and appear to mediate protein&#x2013;protein interactions. The zinc-binding cysteine-rich regions of the PHD finger form two flexible loops and two protein ligands have been proposed to bind one PHD finger simultaneously <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It has been suggested that one of the ligands can be specific for each PHD. For example, the PHD finger of ING2 can bind phosphoinositides whereas PHD of the KAP-1 repressor binds to Mi2&#x3B1;, a component of the NuRD chromatin remodelling complex <xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. Another ligand, which might be common for all PHD fingers, has been long suggested to be chromatin, and recently, PHD domains of ING2 and BPTF proteins were reported to bind tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 <xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. However, despite the determination of its 3-D structure, no conclusive ligand of the AIRE PHD finger has yet been identified <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We and others have shown that AIRE can activate reporter genes from the interferon beta promoter or in a system where AIRE is tethered via heterologous GAL4 DNA binding domain to the reporter <xref rid="bib5 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[5,13]</xref>. The transcriptional activation region of AIRE has been initially mapped to the two C-terminal PHD fingers as the mutations in these domains severely decreased the transactivation capacity <xref rid="bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[13,14]</xref>. More recent reports have shown that several other APECED-causing mutations in the HSR or SAND domain also decrease the AIRE transactivation ability <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>So far, the only known protein partner for AIRE is a general transcriptional co-regulator and histone acetyltransferase, CREBP binding protein (CBP). CBP has been reported to bind directly to AIRE <italic>in vitro</italic>, it colocalizes with AIRE into the nuclear bodies in monocytic cell cultures and it enhances the transcription of reporter genes in collaboration with AIRE <xref rid="bib5 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[5,16]</xref>. The mechanisms how AIRE in collaboration with CBP activates its target genes are largely unknown.</p>
      <p>DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a Ser/Thr kinase that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family. It is formed as holoenzyme in the presence of DNA by two Ku regulatory subunits, Ku70 (70&#xA0;kDa) and Ku80 (86&#xA0;kDa), and a large catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs (465&#xA0;kDa). With very few exceptions, DNA-PKcs is active only when it is in hetero-trimeric complex with Ku proteins and in interaction with DNA or RNA <xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[17,18]</xref>. The main function of DNA-PK is to recognize double stranded DNA breaks and to catalyze a repair process known as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In a similar way, DNA-PK is crucial for V(D)J recombination in developing T and B cells. Concordantly, DNA-PKcs or Ku deficient mice are severely immunodeficient, with elevated radiosensitivity and susceptible for tumor development <xref rid="bib17 bib19" ref-type="bibr">[17,19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In addition to the role of DNA-PK in chromatin repair, DNA-PK has been shown to phosphorylate many proteins involved in cell cycling and transcriptional regulation, such as p53, Sp1, Myc, Fos, Jun, TBP, TFIIB, RNA Polymerase II <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and several nuclear receptors, for example, the glucocorticoid <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, progesterone <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and androgen receptors <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. DNA-PK can positively and negatively modulate transcription. As a repressor, DNA-PK binds directly to a specific DNA sequence element within the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter <xref rid="bib20 bib23" ref-type="bibr">[20,23]</xref>. Similarly, the whole DNA-PK complex has been shown to bind to the E-box/TATA like elements and to suppress the human xanthine oxidoreductase (<italic>hXOR</italic>) gene expression <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. At the same time, the Ku proteins have been described as transcriptional recycling co-activators of androgen receptor <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition to these examples, DNA-PK can modulate gene expression via RNA-dependent phosphorylation of hnRNP proteins <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to further define molecular mechanisms of AIRE functioning, we searched for novel protein partners of AIRE using the GST pull-down approach combined with mass spectrometry. We found that AIRE interacts with DNA-PK complex proteins DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and Ku80. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays demonstrated that DNA-PK phosphorylates the AIRE protein <italic>in vitro</italic> at the residues Thr68 and Ser156. In addition, we show that the mutation of either of the phosphorylation sites significantly decreases AIRE transcriptional activity.</p>

        <title>Plasmids</title>
        <p>Plasmid pGST-PHD1 was generated by insertion of PCR-amplified sequence encoding human AIRE-1 amino acids 293&#x2013;354 into the <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Kpn</italic>I restriction sites of the pETM-30 vector (EMBL-Heidelberg protein expression and purification laboratory). To generate pGST-AIRE-SPP (SAND/PHD1/PHD2), the sequence encoding AIRE amino acids 178&#x2013;482 was cloned into <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Xho</italic>I sites of pGEX1&#x3BB;T-SH3 vector (a gift from K. Saksela, University of Tampere, Finland). pGST AIRE-T68A, pGST-AIRE-S156A and pGST-AIRE-V80L mutation constructs were generated by altering amino acid Thr68 or Ser156 to alanines and V80 to leucine in pGST-AIRE <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The control plasmid pGEX-2T-p53 was a gift from T. Punga (Uppsala University, Sweden). pSI-AIRE-T68A and pSI-AIRE-S156A were prepared by further cloning the mutated AIRE fragments from pGST-AIRE-T68A and pGST-AIRE-S156A into <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Sal</italic>I sites of pSI vector (Promega). To generate luciferase reporter plasmids pBL-INV and pBL-LOR, the promoter areas of involucrin (3737 nt) and loricrin (2217 nt) genes were cut out from the plasmids pTZhINV-nlbgal and pTZhLOR1 (gifts from A. M&#xE4;nnik, FitBiotech, Estonia) and cloned into the <italic>Hin</italic>dIII site of pBL-KS (a gift from K. Saksela, University of Tampere, Finland). The cloned plasmids were verified by sequencing.</p>

Full-length GST-AIRE and PHD-containing fusion proteins were expressed in the presence of 0.1&#xA0;mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. The proteins were purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions except that 1% N-laurylsarcosine and 3% Triton X-100 were added to increase solubility of the proteins and 50&#xA0;&#x3BC;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub> was included when GST-AIRE and PHD-containing fusion proteins were purified. The purified proteins were verified on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.</p>

The beads were washed intensively with buffer B1, the bound proteins were eluted and separated on SDS-PAGE. The specific protein bands were cut out and analyzed with mass spectrometry.</p>
        <p>Mass mapping of the peptides generated was performed with an Ultraflex&#x2122;MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser in a positive ion reflector mode using &#xE1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The MALDI spectra were externally calibrated with the standard peptide mixture from Bruker-Daltonics (Bremen, Germany). In case of a peptide fragmentation analysis, a peptide from above mass mapping analysis was selected as a precursor ion and subjected for further MS/MS fragmentation in the MALDI-TOF/TOF lift-mode. Database searches were carried out by either Mascot peptide map fingerprint or Mascot MS/MS ions search (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com/">http://www.matrixscience.com/</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>The transfections were carried out with ExGen500 <italic>in vitro</italic> reagent (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunoprecipitations, approximately 2&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells were transfected with 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of pcAIRE <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> or either pcDNA3.1B-myc/his (Invitrogen) or pdEYFP-N1 (Clontech) vector. After 46&#xA0;h, a whole-cell extract was prepared by lysis with 0.25&#xA0;ml of lysis buffer (20&#xA0;mM Tris pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 0.3&#xA0;M NaCl, 0.1&#xA0;mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5&#xA0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5&#xA0;mM DTT, 0.2&#xA0;mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, protease inhibitors) for 30&#xA0;min on ice. The lysates were treated five times with the 25G syringe to shear genomic DNA, centrifuged at 13 500&#xA0;rpm, 15&#xA0;min at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C. The supernatants were diluted 5 times with the lysis buffer lacking NP-40 and immunoprecipitations were performed with mouse monoclonal anti-DNA-PK 4F10C5 (BD Pharmingen), anti-AIRE 6.1 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, anti-HuR 3A2 (a gift from J.

Digestion efficiency of MNase was tested in the separate control experiments, using the same conditions.

        <p>The kinase assays were performed with SignaTECT DNA-PK Kinase Assay System kit (Promega) essentially according to the manufacturer's protocol. The phosphorylation reactions were carried out in the presence of &#x3B3;ATP-<sup>32</sup>P for 7&#xA0;min at 30&#xA0;&#xB0;C and either 25&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of biotinylated-p53 peptide (EPPLSQEAFADLWKK, Promega) or 4&#x2013;5&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of GST fusion proteins were used as the substrates. Efficiencies of <sup>32</sup>P labeling of the substrates were measured by radioactivity counter (1414 Guardian, Wallac). Nuclear extracts and immunoprecipitations were made as described in <xref rid="sec2 sec3" ref-type="sec">Sections 2.3 and 2.4</xref>.

        <title>DNA-PK complex proteins co-purify with AIRE PHD domain</title>
        <p>In order to find new AIRE interacting partners, we expressed the first PHD domain (PHD1) of AIRE as a GST-fusion protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) and performed the GST pull-down using the nuclear extract prepared from monocytic THP-1 cells. The interacting proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. Three protein bands with molecular weight of about 70, 80 and over 250&#xA0;kDa were consistently seen after the SDS-PAGE analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Next, the protein bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The MALDI-TOF mass map analysis demonstrated that the two bands with molecular masses of about 70 and 80&#xA0;kDa belong to Ku70 and Ku80, respectively, whereas the protein with the mass over 250&#xA0;kDa was presumed to be the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Mass map identifications with low sequence coverage were further verified by MALDI-TOF/TOF fragmentation of three tryptic peptides (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, these results identified a trimeric complex of DNA-PK as a candidate AIRE interacting partner.</p>

        <title>Full-length AIRE interacts with DNA-PK</title>
        <p>To further confirm the pull-down results and to demonstrate that the full-length AIRE protein is able to interact with DNA-PK, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. So far, no AIRE endogenous expression on protein level has been detected in immortalized cell-lines. As subcellular localization of transfected AIRE in immortalized cell lines is similar to the AIRE localization in thymus <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as AIRE is able to activate transcription in those cells, we transfected HEK293 cells with the plasmid expressing full-length AIRE or empty vector as a negative control. The whole-cell extracts were prepared from transfected cells and used in co-immunoprecipitations with anti-DNA-PKcs, anti-AIRE or various control antibodies. The precipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-AIRE antibody. As seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, anti-DNA-PKcs and anti-AIRE antibodies (as a positive control) were able to precipitate AIRE protein whereas control antibodies against GST, GAPDH and HuR (a nuclear mRNA-binding protein) could not. Similarly, AIRE and DNA-PKcs interaction was detectable when the immunoprecipitation with anti-AIRE antibody followed by the Western with anti-DNA-PKcs antibody was carried out (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Since the whole-cell extracts used in immunoprecipitations contained remarkable amounts of chromatin and RNA (data not shown), we next wanted to test whether the interaction between AIRE and DNA-PK is DNA and RNA dependent or independent. Previously, a DNA intercalator ethidium bromide (EtBr) has been shown to efficiently disrupt the binding of Ku proteins to Oct2 and DNA-PK <xref rid="bib26 bib30" ref-type="bibr">[26,30]</xref>, whereas the micrococcal nuclease has been widely used for the disruption of chromatin as well as for the digestion of contaminating DNA from cell lysates and immunoprecipitates <xref rid="bib26 bib31" ref-type="bibr">[26,31]</xref>. Consequently, we transfected the HEK293 cells with the plasmid expressing full-length myc-tagged AIRE or empty vector as a negative control and performed co-immunoprecipitations with anti-DNA-PKcs antibodies in the presence of EtBr, RNaseA/T mix or treated the immunoprecipitates with the micrococcal nuclease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C, top panel). As a positive control, to show that the same level of the AIRE protein was present in each lysate, the immunoprecipitations were also performed with the anti-myc antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C, bottom panel). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C top panel reveals that DNA-PKcs still co-immunoprecipitates AIRE from the cell extracts treated with EtBr or RNaseA, which indicates that AIRE does not require DNA or RNA to interact with DNA-PKcs. However, when we treated the co-immunoprecipitates with micrococcal nuclease, we observed a weaker interaction between AIRE and DNA-PKcs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C, top panel), which suggests that in the cell lysates containing DNA and chromatin, a fraction of AIRE binds DNA-PK through the DNA and/or chromatin. In conclusion, the co-immunoprecipitation results together confirm that the AIRE protein interacts with DNA-PK.</p>

        <title>DNA-PK phosphorylates the AIRE protein</title>
        <p>DNA-PK is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that has been reported to phosphorylate many nuclear targets. To study whether the AIRE protein is one of the targets of DNA-PK, we used several different assays which enabled quantitation of DNA-PK kinase activity. We first studied whether the AIRE protein co-immunoprecipitates DNA-PK kinase activity. Co-immunoprecipitations from nuclear extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with myc-tagged AIRE were carried out with antibodies recognizing DNA-PKcs, myc tag and GAPDH (as a negative control). The co-immunoprecipitates were further incubated with biotinylated p53 derived peptide as a DNA-PK specific substrate <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> in the presence of DNA-PKcs activating dsDNA and <sup>32</sup>P-&#x3B3;ATP. As a positive control, HEK293 nuclear extract was used instead of the co-immunoprecipitates. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A shows that a similar amount of <sup>32</sup>P was incorporated into the p53 peptide when AIRE and DNA-PKcs co-immunoprecipitates were applied, whereas no activity was detectable with GAPDH co-immunoprecipitate. The relatively high phosphorylation efficiency achieved with AIRE co-immunoprecipitate was most likely due to the reason that the co-immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody is more efficient than that of with DNA-PK antibody. Since the p53 peptide used in the assay is a DNA-PK specific substrate <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, these data show that the AIRE/DNA-PK complex has kinase activity and suggest that AIRE, too, might be phosphorylated by DNA-PK.</p>
        <p>To further investigate whether AIRE can be phosphorylated by DNA-PK, we carried out three different <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays where recombinant GST-AIRE, GST-p53 and GST alone were used as the substrates. First, we performed the experiments using the nuclear extract from HEK293 cells as a source of kinases in the absence or presence of a specific inhibitor for PI3 family kinases, LY294002 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Second, we did the kinase assay using the nuclear extracts either from DNA-PKcs positive (MO59K) or DNA-PKcs negative (MO59J) cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Third, we carried out kinase reactions using a purified HeLa DNA-PK complex, again, in the absence or presence of LY294002 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). As a result, we observed that the phosphorylation level of the AIRE protein reached up to 50&#x2013;80% of that of the p53 protein in all three experimental approaches, whereas only background phosphorylation of GST alone was detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B&#x2013;D). In concordance, the kinase activity was decreased, although moderately, when LY294002 inhibitor was added (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B) or when the nuclear extract from DNA-PKcs negative MO59J cells was used (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C), indicating that besides DNA-PKcs other kinases can phosphorylate the AIRE protein.</p>
        <p>In order to identify which region of the AIRE protein is phosphorylated, we expressed different AIRE domains as GST fusion proteins and tested their phosphorylation using the nuclear extracts as a source of kinases. The domain structure of the AIRE protein is given in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B shows that the HEK293 nuclear extract phosphorylated more efficiently the GST-fusions of N-terminal AIRE containing the first 256 (1&#x2013;256), 293 (1&#x2013;293) or 348 (1&#x2013;348) amino acids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B) while about 2 times less phosphorylation was seen with the GST-fusions of AIRE C-terminal fragments containing SAND (175&#x2013;298) or SAND-PHD1-PHD2 (178&#x2013;482) regions. A similar pattern of AIRE phosphorylation was observed when the phosphorylation assay was performed with DNA-PKcs competent MO59K or DNA-PKcs deficient MO59J cell extracts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). Thus, although in pull-down experiments, the first PHD of AIRE alone was able to interact with DNA-PK, the main DNA-PK target seems to be the N-terminal part of AIRE indicating that AIRE and DNA-PK make multiple contacts. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DNA-PK can phosphorylate AIRE <italic>in vitro</italic> and that the N-terminal region of AIRE is the predominant target of DNA-PK.</p>

        <title>T68 and S156 are the phosphorylation sites on the AIRE protein</title>
        <p>The N-terminal region of AIRE contains the HSR domain that mediates di- or tetramerization of the protein <xref rid="bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref>. Interestingly, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have indicated that AIRE dimerization may occur as a result of phosphorylation <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. We next aimed to find the DNA-PK specific phosphorylation sites on AIRE. Using the Scansite 2.0 and NetPhos 2.0 programs, we found two putative DNA-PK phosphorylation sites: T68 within and S156 close to the HSR domain of the AIRE protein (<xref rid="fig4 fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A and 5A</xref>). To verify the prediction, we changed either Thr68 or Ser156 to alanines, both in wild type GST-AIRE and truncated GST-AIRE (1&#x2013;256) constructs, and tested the influence of these mutations on the phosphorylation efficiency. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B demonstrates that compared to GST-AIRE, the phosphorylation levels of the mutant proteins were decreased about 30&#x2013;50% when the cell extracts from either HEK293 or MO59K cells were used as source of cellular kinases. Finally, we performed the phosphorylation assays using purified DNA-PK complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). In agreement with the previous experiments, a reduction of about 30% in the phosphorylation levels of the T68A and S156A mutants was detected, whereas the APECED patient mutation V80L did not negatively affect the AIRE phosphorylation level. Thus, we conclude that amino acids Thr68 and Ser156 of the AIRE protein are the phosphorylation sites of DNA-PK.</p>

        <title>DNA-PK is expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTEC)</title>
        <p>DNA-PK is a ubiquitously expressed protein which levels are enhanced by induction of DNA double strand brakes <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To study whether the DNA-PK and AIRE interaction might occur in vivo, we studied whether DNA-PK is also present in thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTEC): the only subset of cells where the AIRE protein expression is detected thus far <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x2013;3]</xref>.

        <title>T68A and S156A mutations downregulate the transactivation activity of AIRE</title>
        <p>Previously, it has been demonstrated that several missense mutations in the HSR domain affect the dimerization, cellular localization and the transactivation ability of AIRE <xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib15 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[13&#x2013;15,35]</xref>. Thus, we next tested whether the mutation of AIRE phosphorylation sites influences the AIRE transactivation activity. We cloned AIRE with T68A and S156A mutations into mammalian expression vector and performed luciferase assays using the lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with wild type AIRE or the mutant constructs. As AIRE target genes, human <italic>loricrin</italic> and <italic>involucrin</italic> gene promoters fused to the luciferase gene were used. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A demonstrates that when the HEK293 cells were transfected with AIRE T68A and AIRE S156A mutation constructs, significantly lower transactivation activity compared to the wild type AIRE was seen. Western blot of the transfected lysates with anti-AIRE antibody shows that both mutants are expressed even in higher level than the wild type AIRE construct (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>B). In conclusion, the luciferase assays suggest that the phosphorylation status of AIRE at T68 and S156 is important for the transactivation activity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we demonstrate that AIRE interacts with and is phosphorylated by the DNA-PK complex. The best DNA-PK substrates are the DNA associated proteins and the most effective phosphorylation occurs when DNA-PK is colocalized with the same DNA molecule as its target proteins <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Binding to the Ku proteins improves the affinity of DNA-PKcs for DNA ends about 100-fold <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This is in keeping with the finding showing that AIRE is able to bind DNA via its SAND domain <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition to the double strand brakes, the DNA-PK and/or the Ku proteins are known to bind telomeres and sequence-specific promoter elements <xref rid="bib17 bib24" ref-type="bibr">[17,24]</xref>, single stranded DNA <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, nucleosomes <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, RNA <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and base unpairing regions (BURs) which typically are found in nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Ku70 and Ku80 also colocalize to RNA polymerase II elongation sites <xref rid="bib41 bib42" ref-type="bibr">[41,42]</xref>. Interestingly, AIRE has been reported to associate with nuclear matrix <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and has been proposed to regulate gene clusters <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition, the AIRE protein contains PHD domains, which recently have been shown to recognize specifically modified histones within the chromatin <xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. Thus, AIRE appears to be a chromatin and DNA-binding protein. In this study, we observed that although AIRE is able to bind DNA-PK without DNA, most likely the DNA or chromatin is contributing to the AIRE and DNA-PK interaction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). This is in concordance with DNA-PK ability to phosphorylate its substrates more efficiently at the presence of DNA <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. At least two possibilities can be considered how DNA-PK, AIRE and DNA or chromatin may interact. First, DNA or chromatin, or even certain DNA sequence elements or specifically modified chromatin, may increase the affinity of AIRE for DNA-PK. Second, posttranslationally modified AIRE subpopulations may bind DNA-PK in different conditions. As we cannot exclude that this type of experiments can be influenced by the overexpression of AIRE, further studies are needed to find out the role of chromatin in AIRE and DNA-PK interaction <italic>in vivo,</italic> especially in the thymic environment.</p>
      <p>Phosphorylation of AIRE by cAMP dependent protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC) has been reported earlier <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, though, the phosphorylated domain of AIRE remained unknown. We here demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> the AIRE protein is mainly phosphorylated at the N-terminal region and define two residues, Thr68 and Ser156, as DNA-PK specific target sites. Thr68 resides within and Ser156 is located not far from the HSR domain. Both these phosphorylation sites are located outside the PHD1 finger, the domain of AIRE that was initially shown to pull-down DNA-PK, indicating that multiple different contacts can occur between AIRE and the DNA-PK complex. However, as previously reported <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, our <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation studies also indicate that other kinases may phosphorylate the AIRE protein, and that phosphorylation sites other than Thr68 and Ser156 should exist within AIRE.</p>
      <p>The HSR domain of AIRE has been shown to be responsible for the dimerization and tetramerization of the protein <xref rid="bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[4,5]</xref> and several, but not all, APECED mutations within the HSR decrease AIRE transactivation activity and influence AIRE cellular localization <xref rid="bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[15,16]</xref>. In addition, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have indicated that AIRE dimerization may occur as a result of phosphorylation <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As shown in this study, conversion of Thr68 and Ser156 amino acids to alanines suppresses AIRE transactivation activity. However, we did not observe any influence of these mutations to AIRE dimerization and cellular localization (data not shown). Thus, since the mutations that do not impact AIRE dimerization and the dot formation ability can downregulate AIRE transactivation activity, the N-terminal part of AIRE appears to be involved in transcriptional regulation not only via its dimerization activity. It is possible that status of AIRE phosphorylation at N-terminus influences AIRE interactions with other protein partners or with DNA.</p>
      <p>In response to ionizing radiation, DNA-PK can have indirect effects on transcriptional regulation. It has been shown that phosphorylation of interferon regulated factor 3 (IRF-3) and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) protein by DNA-PK in response to ionizing radiation directs these proteins to degradation by the proteasome and therefore downregulates IRF-3 and PDX-1 target genes <xref rid="bib45 bib46" ref-type="bibr">[45,46]</xref>. Alternatively, phosphorylation of transcription factor Oct-1 by DNA-PK in response to ionizing radiation leads to stabilization but disrupts transactivation activity of Oct-1. As a result, the expression of Oct-1 target genes U6 and Histone H2B is downregulated <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. We also studied whether UV irradiation changes AIRE cellular localization and expression level in various cell cultures but we could not detect remarkable differences (data not shown). Thus, it seems that DNA-PK phosphorylates AIRE independently of its function in DNA repair.</p>
      <p>Based on research on AIRE deficient mice, it is evident that AIRE upregulates the expression level of many genes in thymus <xref rid="bib48 bib49" ref-type="bibr">[48,49]</xref>. Studies in tissue culture cells confirm that AIRE indeed activates several promoters <xref rid="bib5 bib13 bib15 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[5,13,15,16]</xref>. Thus, although <italic>in vivo</italic> the AIRE protein expression is only detected in thymic medullary epithelial cells <xref rid="bib1 bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x2013;3]</xref>, the transfected AIRE protein has similar transactivating properties, and nuclear localization pattern as AIRE in the thymus <xref rid="bib14 bib16" ref-type="bibr">[14,16]</xref>. Despite these studies, the mechanisms of how AIRE regulates its target genes are still unclear. Posttranscriptional modifications, like phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination, are widely used to regulate activity of transcription factors and regulators. In this study, we first describe the phosphorylation sites of AIRE and propose that its phosphorylation status is important for its transactivation activity. However, several questions remain, including what are the signals that trigger AIRE phosphorylation and how AIRE phosphorylation is connected with its function in the thymus. The differentiation of AIRE positive thymic epithelial cells was recently shown to be dependent on RANK-mediated signaling <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, which is known to activate several protein kinases <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. As we showed in this study, DNA-PK is expressed in medullary epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Whether the thymic epithelial differentiation process correlates with the activation of DNA-PK and other possible AIRE-specific kinases needs further studies.</p>

(A, B) Whole-cell extracts were prepared either from AIRE or control transfected HEK293 cells, and used in co-immunoprecipitations as indicated. Antibodies that were applied in co-immunoprecipitations are indicated above. 1% of AIRE transfected whole-cell extract was loaded to control the expression of AIRE. Western blot was carried out with anti-AIRE (A) or anti-DNA-PKc (B) antibodies, positions of AIRE, cross-reacting IgG bands (A) and DNA-PK (B) are indicated left. Asterisk designates a nonspecific band occurring with anti-HA control antibody (B). (C) DNA-PK can interact with AIRE independently of DNA and RNA. For co-immunoprecipitations, either AIRE or control transfected HEK293 cells were used. Ethidium bromide (EtBr), micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and RnaseA/T mix treatment was performed where specified. Co-immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-DNA-PK and anti-myc antibodies as indicated.
