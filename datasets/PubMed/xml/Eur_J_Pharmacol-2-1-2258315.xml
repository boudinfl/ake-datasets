      <abstract>
        <p>Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown algae, has a wide range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and anti-tumor activities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of fucoidan on CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver fibrosis. Administration of fucoidan reduced CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced acute and chronic liver failure. Hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl<sub>4</sub> was also attenuated by injection of fucoidan. Damage to hepatocytes and activation of hepatic stellate cells are key events in liver fibrosis, and, interestingly, treatment of hepatocytes with fucoidan prevented CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced cell death and inhibited the proliferation hepatic stellate cells. These results indicate that fucoidan might be a promising anti-fibrotic agent possessing dual functions, namely, protection of hepatocytes and inhibition of hepatic stellate cell proliferation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hepatic fibrosis results from chronic damage to the liver in conjunction with the progressive accumulation of fibrillar extracellular matrix proteins (<xref rid="bib4 bib7 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Friedman, 1993; Gressner, 1995; Lieber, 1999</xref>). The main causes of liver fibrosis are infection with hepatitis B or C, alcohol abuse, and non-alcohol steatohepatitis. There are over 100 million people with hepatic fibrosis in the world.</p>
      <p>The liver consists of parenchymal (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal cells (Kupffer, stellate, and endothelial cells). Hepatic fibrosis is triggered by specific intercellular interactions among some of these cells. Kupffer cells are activated by membrane components from damaged hepatocytes and infiltrating inflammatory cells. The activated Kupffer cells release pro-fibrotic factors, such as transforming growth factor-&#x3B2;, reactive oxygen species, and other factors (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). These pro-fibrotic factors act on hepatic stellate cells, which are key players in hepatic fibrosis (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gressner, 1995</xref>).</p>
      <p>Hepatic stellate cells are normally quiescent and produce only small amounts of extracellular matrix components, such as laminin and collagen type IV, during the formation of basement membrane (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Maher and Bissell, 1993</xref>). Exposure of hepatic stellate cells to the pro-fibrotic factors activates hepatic stellate cells, leading to a changed to a myofibroblast phenotype and an increase in the production of collagen (<xref rid="bib5 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Friedman, 1999; Geerts, 2001</xref>). Preventing the activation of hepatic stellate cells is thus a promising anti-fibrotic strategy. Indeed, administration of antioxidants has been shown to suppress the activation of hepatic stellate cells, thereby preventing liver fibrosis, and inhibition of hepatocyte cell death can reduce liver fibrosis (<xref rid="bib11 bib21 bib10 bib3 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Houglum et al., 1997; Maher et al., 1997; Horie et al., 2003; Canbay et al., 2002; Song et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Brown algae seaweeds contain both soluble dietary fiber polysaccharides, including alginates, fucans, and laminarans, and insoluble fibers, which are mostly composed of cellulose (<xref rid="bib17 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Lahaye and Kaeffer, 1997; Kloareg and Quatrano, 1988</xref>). The fucans are cell wall polysaccharides that contain variable amounts of fucose, uronic acids, galactose, xylose, and sulfate. They are classified in three types according to their chemical composition: fucoidan, ascophyllan, and glucuronofuco-galactan sulfate (<xref rid="bib17 bib16 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lahaye and Kaeffer, 1997; Kloareg and Quatrano, 1988; Mabeau et al., 1990</xref>). Fucoidan is a complex sulfated polysaccharide derived from <italic>Fucus vesiculosus</italic>, and it has a variety of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-liver failure, and anti-tumor activities (<xref rid="bib2 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Boisson-Vidal et al., 1995; Saito et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, fucoidan interacts with transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; and has antioxidative properties (<xref rid="bib33 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2001; McCaffrey et al., 1994</xref>). These findings indicate that fucoidan may have anti-fibrotic activity, but whether fucoidan can attenuate hepatic fibrosis is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of fucoidan on hepatic injury and fibrosis. We found that fucoidan may be useful as a novel type of anti-fibrotic agent.</p>

        <p>CCl<sub>4</sub> was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals, Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Fucoidan was obtained from Sigma Chemical, Co. Ltd. (St. Louis, MO). CCl<sub>4</sub> and fucoidan were dissolved in olive oil and saline in animal experiment, respectively. In cellular experiments, fucoidan was dissolved in cultured medium for hepatocytes or hepatic stellate cells as described below. CCl<sub>4</sub> was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at 100&#xA0;mM.</p>

        <title>Animals and experimental protocols</title>
        <p>All of the experimental protocols conformed to the ethics guidelines of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University. Male Sprague&#x2013;Dawley rats (200&#x2013;250&#xA0;g) and male ddy mice (6&#xA0;weeks old) were obtained from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room (lights on from 8:00 to 20:00; temperature, 23&#xA0;&#xB1;1.5&#xA0;&#xB0;C). Animals had free access to water and commercial chow (Type MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
        <p>In the acute liver injury model, CCl<sub>4</sub> was intraperitoneally administrated to mice at 0.3&#xA0;ml/kg body weight with or without intravenous injection of fucoidan (25 and 50&#xA0;mg/kg body weight). After 24&#xA0;h of fucoidan injection, the mice were anesthetized, and the blood was recovered. In the chronic liver injury model, CCl<sub>4</sub> (0.3&#xA0;ml/kg body weight) and fucoidan (50&#xA0;mg/kg body weight) were administered orally and intravenously, respectively, to mice twice a week for 8&#xA0;weeks. The liver and blood were recovered from the mice under anesthesia. The serum was separated from the blood and stored at &#x2212;&#xA0;20&#xA0;&#xB0;C before assay.</p>

        <title>Effect of fucoidan on acute liver injury</title>
        <p>We first examined the effect of fucoidan on acute liver failure induced by single injection of CCl<sub>4</sub>. Intraperitoneal injection of mice with CCl<sub>4</sub> increased biochemical markers of liver injury. Specifically, 24&#xA0;h after injection of CCl<sub>4</sub>, serum AST and ALT had increased from 125 to 707 and from 21 to 752 karumen unit/ml, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Intravenous administration of fucoidan attenuated this elevation of serum AST and ALT (304 and 214 karumen unit/ml, respectively, at 25&#xA0;mg/kg fucoidan). Notably, injection of 50&#xA0;mg/kg fucoidan restored serum AST and ALT to normal levels (77 and 67 karumen unit/ml, respectively). Together, these results indicate that fucoidan is a potent inhibitor of acute CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury.</p>

        <title>Effect of fucoidan on chronic liver injury</title>
        <p>To evaluate the effect of fucoidan on chronic liver injury, we continuously administered CCl<sub>4</sub> to mice twice a week for 8&#xA0;weeks. Serum AST and ALT levels increased from 149 to 433 and from 101 to 568 karumen unit/ml, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Azan staining revealed that collagen accumulated in the liver, indicating the onset of liver fibrosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Indeed, the fibrotic area in the liver increased from 1.9% to 14.8% of the whole liver (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The elevation of AST and ALT levels was significantly reduced by administration of fucoidan (from 433 to 265 and from 568 to 238 karumen unit/ml, respectively; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). The increase in fibrotic area induced by CCl<sub>4</sub> was also attenuated by fucoidan (from 14.8% to 4.3%; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). Together, these findings show that fucoidan may be useful for treatment of hepatic fibrosis in chronic liver injury.</p>

        <title>Effect of fucoidan on hepatocytes and stellate cells</title>
        <p>As described above, our preliminary results indicated that fucoidan may be useful for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. During the initiation of hepatic fibrosis, hepatocytes release a paracrine factor that stimulates hepatic stellate cell growth, leading to the damage of hepatocyte membranes (<xref rid="bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gressner, 1995; Gutierrez-Reyes et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, to determine how fucoidan prevents liver injury, we evaluated its effects on hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, treatment of hepatocytes with CCl<sub>4</sub> (1&#xA0;mM) reduced their viability to 63.3% of control (untreated) cells. In addition, fucoidan dose-dependently reduced CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced cell death, with complete prevention of cell death at 1&#xA0;mg/ml. Alone, fucoidan did not show any cytotoxicity at 1.0&#xA0;mg/ml in hepatocytes (data not shown). CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced cell death was not inhibited by pre-incubation of CCl<sub>4</sub> with fucoidan (data not shown), indicating that the protective effects of fucoidan on CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced cell death is not due to absorption of CCl<sub>4</sub> by fucoidan. In contrast, the viability of hepatic stellate cells was reduced to 26.4% of the control by a 48-h treatment with 1.0&#xA0;mg/ml fucoidan (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Thus, both the protective effects of fucoidan against CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced cell death in hepatocytes and its cytotoxicity to hepatic stellate cells might contribute to its anti-fibrotic activity.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Fucoidan, the sulfated polysaccharides of brown algae, contains <sc>l</sc>-fucose residues as the main sugar constituent along with sulfate esters. Although fucoidan is known to have many biological activities, including anti-coagulant, anti-thrombosis, anti-inflammatory, anti-liver failure, and anti-tumor activities (<xref rid="bib2 bib1 bib26" ref-type="bibr">Boisson-Vidal et al., 1995; Berteau and Mulloy, 2003; Saito et al., 2006</xref>), this is the first investigation of its anti-fibrotic activity. Our results show for the first time that fucoidan can reduce hepatic fibrosis in an animal model.</p>
      <p>Studies in animal models of hepatic fibrosis show that extracellular matrix components accumulate in interstitial regions of the liver around central veins or in the portal tracts. Normally, hepatic stellate cells exist in a quiescent state, but they become activated following liver injury. These activated hepatic stellate cells are primarily responsible for the excess production of extracellular matrix (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Senoo et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, reduction of extracellular matrix production by activated hepatic stellate cells is crucial for the prevention of fibrogenesis. Damage to hepatocytes is the primary and continuing factor leading to hepatic stellate cell activation. Components released from the damaged cells, including lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen species, activate Kupffer cells in the liver, leading to their secretion of transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Tsukamoto, 1999</xref>). These pro-fibrogenic factors activate hepatic stellate cells, which results in liver fibrosis. Here, we showed that treatment of hepatocytes with fucoidan attenuates CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced cell death.</p>
      <p>Fucoidan has been reported to interact with transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; and to scavenge reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="bib2 bib22 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Boisson-Vidal et al., 1995; McCaffrey et al., 1994; Xue et al., 2001</xref>). CCl<sub>4</sub> elevates serum transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; levels and acts as a hepatotoxin by inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Weiler-Normann et al., 2007</xref>). In agreement with this, we have found that administration of fucoidan reduces CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced lipid peroxidation (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that the anti-fibrogenic activity of fucoidan is due, at least in part, to attenuation of hepatic stellate cell activation by inhibition of transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; and/or by scavenging of reactive oxygen species, which can suppress the cascade of events that leads to hepatic stellate cell activation.</p>
      <p>Hepatocyte injury is thought to promote fibrosis, leading to the release of activators from Kupffer cells. In contrast, hepatic stellate cell apoptosis is thought to be essential for the resolution phase of fibrosis (<xref rid="bib3 bib29 bib12 bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">Canbay et al., 2002; Song et al., 2003; Iredale, 2001; Iredale et al., 1998; Issa et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, a compound that can prevent hepatocyte injury and/or induce the death of hepatic stellate cells should be useful for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. In the current studies we showed that fucoidan reduces the growth of hepatic stellate cells and that it can protect hepatocytes from injury. We also found that the fucoidan-treated hepatic stellate cells were stained with annexin V, a marker of apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that fucoidan may be useful for treating hepatic fibrosis.</p>
      <p>Most studies on fucoidan have used a commercially available crude extract from <italic>F. vesiculosus</italic>, and we used the crude fucoidan in the current study. Fucoidan contains heteropolysaccharides of various kinds besides those consisting predominantly of sulfate and fucose (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Nishino et al., 1994</xref>). Patel et al. found that crude commercial fucoidan was more active than the purified fucoidan at inhibiting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and then they speculated that a specific structure in the crude fucoidan may mediate its biological activities (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, the content of the sulfated groups in fucoidan determines its anti-proliferative and anti-coagulant activities in fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Haroun-Bouhedja et al., 2000</xref>). The biological activities may differ among the various structures of pure fucoidan as well as the different components of crude fucoidan. Identification of the structures of fucoidan that protect hepatocytes from hepatotoxins and that inhibit hepatic stellate cell growth is needed for the development of fucoidan as an anti-fibrotic agent.</p>
      <p>In summary, we found that fucoidan prevents hepatocyte cell death and induces the death of hepatic stellate cells in an animal model of hepatic fibrosis. Future studies will examine the molecular mechanisms of fucoidan in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. This is the first report that fucoidan has anti-fibrotic activity and that it is a promising lead for the development of anti-fibrotic agents. Identification of the molecular target and the active structure of fucoidan may lead to the development of novel anti-fibrotic agents.</p>

        <p>Effect of fucoidan on CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced chronic hepatic injury. Mice were injected orally with CCl<sub>4</sub> (0.3&#xA0;ml/kg body weight) and intravenously with fucoidan (50&#xA0;mg/kg body weight) twice a week for 8&#xA0;weeks. (A) Blood was recovered for determination of serum AST (open column) and ALT (slashed column). Results indicate are means&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;S.D. (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;4). (B) Livers were recovered, sectioned, and stained with Azan. Blue and red areas correspond to fibrotic and normal regions, respectively. (C) The ratio of the fibrotic blue area to the blue and red area of the liver was calculated from the sections using NIH Scion Image. The calculation was performed on five images. Results represent means&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;S.D. (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;4).</p>

        <p>Effect of fucoidan on CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. (A) Effect of fucoidan on CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced cell death in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> (1.0&#xA0;mg/ml) in the absence or presence of fucoidan at the indicated concentration for 3&#xA0;h. Viable cells were counted by Trypan blue staining. Results represent means&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;S.D. (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;4). (B) Effect of fucoidan on growth of hepatic stellate cells. Hepatic stellate cells were treated with fucoidan at the indicated concentration for 24 and 48&#xA0;h. The viability of the cells was assayed by mitochondrial conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. The growth ratio was calculated as a percentage of the viability at 0&#xA0;h. Results represent means&#xA0;&#xB1;&#xA0;S.D. (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;4).</p>
