        <p>Tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>) plants emit a blend of volatile organic compounds, which mainly consists of terpenes. Upon herbivory or wounding, the emission of several terpenes increases. We have identified and characterized the first two tomato monoterpene synthases, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2. Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (<italic>R</italic>)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (<italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced &#x3B2;-phellandrene, &#x3B2;-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: <italic>LeMTS1</italic> was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while <italic>LeMTS2</italic> was strongest expressed in stems and roots. <italic>LeMTS1</italic> expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while <italic>LeMTS2</italic> did not respond to these stimuli. The expression of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> in stems and petioles was predominantly detected in trichomes and could be induced by JA. Because JA treatment strongly induced emission of linalool and overexpression of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> in tomato resulted in increased production of linalool, we propose that LeMTS1 is a genuine linalool synthase. Our results underline the importance of trichomes in JA-induced terpene emission in tomato.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plants produce a wide variety of terpenoids that have primary functions as hormones (gibberellins, abscisic acid, brassinolide), sterols, pigments (carotenoids, phytol), and as parts of electron carrier moieties (ubiquinone, plastoquinone) (McGarvey and Croteau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1995</xref>). Most terpenoids, however, are secondary metabolites: over 20,000 different terpenoid structures from plants have been described (Sacchettini and Poulter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1997</xref>). Some terpenoids function in the direct defence strategy of plants as phytoalexins, which accumulate upon pathogen infection. Sesquiterpene phytoalexins (e.g., capsidiol) are characteristic for the Solanaceae (Chappell and Nable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1987</xref>; Egea et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes can function in the interaction of plants with other organisms. They are present in floral scents that attract pollinators (Knudsen et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1993</xref>; Langenheim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1994</xref>) and are emitted by many plant species in response to herbivory by insects or spider mites. Induced terpene emission can attract predators or parasitoids of the herbivores, a mechanism commonly referred to as the indirect defense strategy of plants. This has been studied in, for instance, Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) (Van Poecke et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2001</xref>), lima bean (<italic>Phaseolus lunatus</italic>) (Dicke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1994</xref>; Takabayashi and Dicke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1996</xref>), tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>; <italic>N. attenuata</italic>), maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), and cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>) (De Moraes et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1998</xref>; Pare and Tumlinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1999</xref>), and tomato (Kant et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>; Takabayashi et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>These volatile terpenes are produced by sesqui- and monoterpene synthases of which several are induced by herbivory. For instance, nerolidol synthase activity is induced in lima bean, cucumber (<italic>Cucumis sativus</italic>), and maize (Bouwmeester et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1999</xref>; Degenhardt and Gershenzon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2000</xref>), whereas transcript levels of various other sesquiterpene synthases increase in, amongst others, maize (Shen et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2000</xref>), cucumber (Mercke et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>), and wormwood (<italic>Artemisia annua</italic>) (Cai et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>). In Arabidopsis, caterpillars (<italic>Pieris rapae</italic>) induce the myrcene/ocimene synthase <italic>AtTPS10</italic> and the &#x3B2;-ocimene synthase <italic>AtTPS03</italic>, which coincides with increased myrcene emission (Van Poecke et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2001</xref>). Moreover, a &#x3B2;-ocimene synthase (<italic>LjE&#x3B2;OS</italic>) has been identified from Lotus (<italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>), which is induced by spider mite-feeding, resulting in increased emission of &#x3B2;-ocimene (Arimura et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004b</xref>). However, artificial wounding or jasmonic acid (JA) treatment are often also sufficient to induce terpene synthases. The wound- and JA-induced synthesis of terpenes by coniferous plants is well described (Martin et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2002</xref>; Miller et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2005</xref>; Steele et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1995</xref>), and these treatments also mimic herbivore-induced responses in several angiosperms (Arimura et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004a</xref>; Gomez et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>; Schnee et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2002</xref>; Shen et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here we describe the identification and characterization of the first two monoterpene synthases from a solanaceous species (tomato), <italic>LeMTS1</italic> and <italic>LeMTS2</italic>. We provide evidence that these genes are differentially regulated and more importantly, that expression of linalool synthase <italic>LeMTS1</italic> is restricted to trichomes and induced by JA.</p>

        <title>Identification of tomato terpene synthases 1 and 2 (<italic>LeMTS1</italic> and <italic>LeMTS2</italic>)</title>
        <p>In order to identify tomato monoterpene synthases that are induced upon spider mite herbivory, we first queried tomato EST databases (www.tigr.org and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) with known monoterpene synthase sequences from other plant species. Retrieved tomato EST sequences were used to design a primer specific for monoterpene synthases (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We then used cDNA derived from spider mite-infested plants, to amplify a single 850&#xA0;bp fragment with this primer and an oligo dT(18) primer. This fragment was subsequently used as a probe to screen available tomato cDNA libraries. Two different full-length cDNAs were identified; <italic>LeMTS1</italic> (AY840091) was isolated from tomato leaves (sequence identical to the probe) and <italic>LeMTS2</italic> (AY840092) from tomato roots and stems. The <italic>LeMTS1</italic> and <italic>LeMTS2</italic> open reading frames encode proteins of 609 and 590 amino acids (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which have predicted masses of 70.8 and 68.6&#xA0;kDa, respectively, and are 71% identical. LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 contain amino acid motifs conserved in angiosperm (mono)terpene synthases. These are, based on LeMTS1 amino acid positions: R(45)R(46)W(55), required for the initial diphosphate migration (Williams et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1998</xref>); D(362)D(363)D(366), required for binding of a Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion, which is used as cofactor (Cane et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>; Starks et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1997</xref>); D(505)T(509)E(513), required for binding of a second Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> cofactor; and D(586) in the active site cleft (Schwab et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2001</xref>; Whittington et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2002</xref>). LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 contain both putative (predicted with TargetP; Emanuelsson et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2000</xref>) plastid targeting signal peptides, which should be processed in the region upstream of the conserved R(45)R(46) arginine pair.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 with three terpene synthases. A ClustalW alignment is shown of Mentha aquatica linalool synthase, a monoterpene synthase (C10), MaLin (AAL99381); Lycopersicon esculentum monoterpene synthase 1, LeMTS1 (AY840091); <italic>L. esculentum</italic> monoterpene synthase 2, LeMTS2 (AY840092); Mentha longifolia limonene synthase, MlLim (AAD50304), and <italic>L. esculentum</italic> germacrene C synthase, a typical sesquiterpene synthase (C15), LeGerC (AAC39432). Amino acids are shaded dark if identical in at least three of the five sequences and light if identical in LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 only. Conserved amino acid motifs typical for terpene synthases are boxed: RRx<sub>8</sub>W (Williams et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1998</xref>), DDxxD (Cane et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>; Starks et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1997</xref>), Dx<sub>3</sub>Tx<sub>3</sub>E, and D (Schwab et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2001</xref>; Whittington et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2002</xref>). The presence of putative N-terminal plastid targeting peptides in the four monoterpene synthases and the primer used for amplifying the initial LeMTS fragment from cDNA of spider mite-infested leaves are indicated</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="11103_2007_9149_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>Remarkably, LeMTS1 contains an extra sequence stretch of 22 amino acids starting at N170 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This sequence is not found in any other terpene synthase, nor does it have homology to any protein in the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Its presence can also not be explained by alternative splicing since the flanks do not contain canonical splice sites. This extra internal element is not an artefact of the isolated cDNA since it was present in four independent cDNAs isolated from different organs (data not shown).</p>

        <title>LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 belong to the TPSb subfamily of terpene synthases</title>
        <p>LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 are more similar to typical monoterpene synthases from, e.g., mint and citrus than to a typical tomato sesquiterpene synthase (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Based on protein sequence relatedness, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 can be classified in the <italic>TPSb</italic> subfamily (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), a distinct group of angiosperm monoterpene synthases, according to the original classification proposed by Bohlmann et&#xA0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>). So, unlike the snapdragon (<italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic>) monoterpene synthases from subfamily TPSg (Dudareva et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>), including an Arabidopsis and a strawberry terpene synthase, the monoterpene synthases from the solanaceous family do not seem to form a new subfamily.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 belong to the TPSb subfamily of terpene synthases. The TPS family is divided into subfamilies according to the nomenclature of Bohlmann et&#xA0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>). TPSa: angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases, TPSb: angiosperm monoterpene synthases, TPSc: angiosperm diterpene synthases, TPSd: gymnosperm mono-sesqui- and diterpene synthases, TPSe: a second group of angiosperm diterpene synthases, TPSf: a distinct group of (putative) linalool synthases mainly from Clarkia (Dudareva et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1996</xref>) and TPSg: a recently identified group of monoterpene synthases mainly from Antirrhinum (Dudareva et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>).

        <title>Terpene synthase activity of recombinant LeMTS1 and LeMTS2</title>
        <p>Recombinant LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 proteins were produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in order to characterize their enzymatic activities. The plastid targeting peptide was deleted up to one amino acid upstream of the RRX<sub>8</sub>W motif (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to produce a His-tagged &#x2018;pseudo-mature&#x2019; form of the proteins, since it has been reported that this can improve protein expression without affecting activity and product specificity of the enzymes (Bohlmann et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</xref>; Williams et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1998</xref>). The soluble protein fractions were assayed for terpene synthase activity and products were analyzed on a GC coupled to a Time Of Flight-MS. Using the monoterpene precursor geranyl diphosphate (GPP) as substrate, LeMTS1 generated only linalool whereas LeMTS2 generated several monoterpene products: &#x3B2;-phellandrene, &#x3B2;-myrcene, and sabinene (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Mass spectra and relative retention indices (Adams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>) or authentic standards confirmed the identification of terpene reaction products. Extracts of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing the empty vector control generated minor amounts of linalool (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and occasionally geraniol. Thermally induced autoconversion or solvolysis of GPP to linalool has been observed before (Crowell et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>; Jia et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1999</xref>), as well as conversion to geraniol by aspecific hydrolase or phosphatase activity in protein extracts (Crowell et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>). However, LeMTS1 product levels are several hundred-fold higher than the background levels of the control (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).

        <p>For plants that contain glandular trichomes, monoterpene production is considered to be localized exclusively in these organs (Gershenzon et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1992</xref>; Iijima et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>; Kutchan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2005</xref>; Turner et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">1999</xref>; Turner and Croteau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2004</xref>). Tomato plants possess several types of trichomes including glandular trichomes that are present in high density on leaves, petioles, and stems and that contain terpenes (Maluf et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2001</xref>; Snyder and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1985</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the location of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> and <italic>LeMTS2</italic> expression in trichomes of petioles and stems.

        <title><italic>LeMTS1</italic> but not <italic>LeMTS2</italic> is induced by spider mite feeding, artificial wounding, and jasmonic acid</title>
        <p>To study whether <italic>LeMTS1</italic> and <italic>LeMTS2</italic> were induced upon spider mite feeding, changes in transcript levels of intact plants were analyzed by RT-PCR since <italic>LeMTS</italic> gene-expression was too low to determine by RNA gel-blot analysis. Expression of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> was indeed induced in leaves by spider mite-feeding, but <italic>LeMTS2</italic>, which expression was very low in leaves, was not (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Spider mites damage plant tissue and induce JA- and SA-responsive genes such as a wound-induced proteinase inhibitor (<italic>WIPI-II</italic>) and a pathogenesis related protein (<italic>PRP6</italic>), respectively (Kant et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the effects of artificial wounding and exogenous application of JA and SA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Both artificial wounding and JA induced <italic>LeMTS1</italic>. In contrast, <italic>LeMTS2</italic> was not induced by these treatments (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). SA-treatment induced the SA-marker <italic>PRP6</italic> but neither <italic>LeMTS1</italic> nor <italic>LeMTS2</italic> was increased. Induction of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> and <italic>WIPI-II</italic> was validated by real-time Q-RT-PCR. This showed consistent and clear induction of both genes by JA, artificial wounding and spider mites, although there was large variation in the level of induction between independent experiments (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). We routinely used the tomato cultivar Moneymaker for our experiments. However, in our earlier work (Ament et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>; Kant et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>) the cultivar Castlemart (CM) was used because it has the same genetic background as the <italic>defenseless1</italic> (<italic>def-1</italic>) mutant (Howe et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1996</xref>).

        <p>Since basal LeMTS1 expression in stems and petioles seemed to be restricted to trichomes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b), we addressed the question whether JA would induce expression of LeMTS1 solely in trichomes or also in other tissues. Indeed, JA-induced LeMTS1 expression was strongest in trichomes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Interestingly, WIPI-II expression showed the opposite pattern. WIPI-II expression is very low in trichomes and basal as well as strongly induced WIPI-II expression occurred mainly in the complementary stem tissues.

        <p>Figure&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b showed that, in petioles and stems, <italic>LeMTS1</italic> was expressed specifically in the trichomes.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Monoterpenes are abundantly emitted by tomato plants. For instance &#x3B2;-pinene, &#x3B2;-myrcene, 2-carene, &#x3B2;-phellandrene, limonene, and terpinolene are constitutively emitted, while linalool and &#x3B2;-ocimene emission is induced after spider mite feeding (Kant et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>). In this paper, we describe the first two monoterpene synthases from tomato, <italic>LeMTS1</italic> and <italic>LeMTS2</italic> and show that <italic>LeMTS1</italic> is induced by JA in trichomes.</p>
      <sec id="Sec11">
        <title>Identification of two tomato monoterpene synthases</title>
        <p>In vitro assays with the recombinant LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 proteins show that LeMTS1 has both (<italic>R</italic>)-linalool synthase and (<italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol synthase activity, and that LeMTS2 is a &#x3B2;-phellandrene/&#x3B2;-myrcene/sabinene synthase (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). LeMTS1 activity in planta seems restricted to linalool synthase activity since increased <italic>LeMTS1</italic> expression by wounding, JA-treatment and ectopic overexpression led to increased linalool emission but did not affect nerolidol levels (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, monoterpene synthases are plastid targeted and use GPP, while sesquiterpene synthases use FPP in the cytosol. There are however some exceptions to this rule. For instance, a cytosolic strawberry nerolidol synthase (FaNES1) has both (<italic>3S</italic>)(<italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol synthase and <italic>S</italic>-linalool synthase activity and is likely responsible for both linalool and nerolidol synthesis in planta (Aharoni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>). Vice versa, when FaNES1 was targeted to the plastid in Arabidopsis it also produced both linalool and nerolidol (Aharoni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>). The authors suggested that GPP and FPP substrate pools are not strictly separated between the cytosol and plastid, which has recently been supported by similar engineering experiments in tobacco (Wu et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2006</xref>). These observations might be explainable by for instance cytosolic as well as plastidial targeting of GPP synthase (GPS) in Arabidopsis and <italic>Litospermum erythrorizon</italic> (Bouvier et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>; Sommer et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1995</xref>). In addition, FPP might be transported from the cytosol into plastids (Lichtenthaler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1999</xref>) and finally, the prenyltransferases GPS, FPS or GGPS might generate multiple products. However, since induced <italic>LeMTS1</italic> expression does not correlate with increased nerolidol emission but only with increased linalool emission (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), we consider LeMTS1 to be a linalool synthase. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the plastidial FPP concentrations in tomato are negligible.</p>
        <p>Despite their high sequence homology (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 have different biochemical activities. It is commonly found that different terpene synthases within one plant species often have higher sequence similarity to one another than to functionally related terpene synthases of other plant species. For example, &#x3B2;-pinene synthase from citrus (<italic>Citrus limon</italic>) is more homologous to the citrus &#x3B3;-terpinene synthase than to &#x3B2;-pinene synthase from wormwood (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It is also known from work with other terpene synthases that product specificity can depend on only a few amino acids (Kollner et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>; Rising et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2000</xref>; Yoshikuni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2006</xref>) and thus, product specificity of terpene synthases is not predictable on basis of protein sequence or specific amino acid residues. By comparing terpene synthase structures, attempts have been made to ascribe substrate binding and substrate modifications to certain residues. Modeling of the active sites of a Salvia (<italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>) sabinene synthase, a mint (<italic>Mentha citrata</italic>) limonene synthase and a mint linalool synthase led to the following observation (Crowell et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>): compared to the other two enzymes, the linalool synthase has a three amino acid deletion in the active site pocket (two amino acids after the conserved D591, see Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), resulting in a more open structure of the so called J/K loop and providing an easier access of water during substrate ionization. Water access results in the premature release of the intermediate monoterpenol carbo-cation, before cyclization to a monoterpene olefin (non-hydrated) can occur. The tomato linalool synthase LeMTS1 also has a deletion in the active site pocket after the conserved D586 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although the deletion is eight instead of three amino acids, it indicates that LeMTS1 might utilize a similar structural mechanism to generate a monoterpene alcohol.</p>

        <title><italic>LeMTS1</italic> expression correlates with induced linalool emission</title>
        <p>The induction of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> expression correlated with the increased emission of linalool by tomato plants. Wounding and JA application induced <italic>LeMTS1</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) as well as linalool emission (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a). Induction of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> upon spider mite-feeding (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) coincided with linalool emission (Kant et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>) in the tomato cultivar CM. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> resulted in enhanced production of linalool (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b) and no other volatile terpenes, providing evidence for in planta linalool synthase activity of LeMTS1. RNAi lines suppressing <italic>LeMTS1</italic> expression in trichomes would provide additional evidence that LeMTS1 acts as a linalool synthase in planta.</p>
        <p>It is generally known that successful overexpression of terpene synthases can be problematic (reviewed by Chappell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>). Substrate limitation and product conversions can explain low-terpene production levels (Aharoni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>; Lucker et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2001</xref>; Ohara et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2003</xref>). In addition, ectopic terpene synthase overexpression might lead to product toxicity (Aharoni et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>; Besumbes et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>) and selection for plant lines with low transgene expression or low terpene accumulation (Diemer et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>; Krasnyanski et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1999</xref>). We managed to regenerate only one <italic>LeMTS1</italic> overexpressing plant line after four successive, independent transformations. The empty vector and unrelated constructs gave at least 20-fold higher transformation frequencies. Similarly, <italic>LeMTS2</italic> overexpression was unsuccessful, seven transgenic plant lines showed only expression of truncated transcripts (data not shown).</p>
        <p><italic>LeMTS2</italic> is expressed in roots, stems and petioles (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). In roots, only minute amounts of the main LeMTS2 product &#x3B2;-phellandrene were detected, hardly visible in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> since levels are &#x223C;300-fold lower than in leaves. The role of monoterpenes in roots remains unclear, although they might play a role in the defense response of plants. The release of the monoterpene 1,8-cineole from Arabidopsis roots is induced upon bacterial pathogen infection (Steeghs et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2004</xref>), although transcriptional regulation of the corresponding 1,8-cineole synthase (Chen et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>) has not been shown yet.</p>
        <p>Although <italic>LeMTS2</italic> is hardly expressed in tomato leaves (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), &#x3B2;-phellandrene and &#x3B2;-myrcene are constitutively emitted by tomato plants (Buttery et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1987</xref>; Kant et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>). This suggests that the constitutive low expression of <italic>LeMTS2</italic> might be sufficient to generate these monoterpenes. However, like the majority of volatile terpenes (data not shown), &#x3B2;-phellandrene is mostly located in trichomes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) where <italic>LeMTS2</italic> is not expressed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). This indicates that there are other &#x3B2;-phellandrene/&#x3B2;-myrcene synthases in tomato that synthesize these terpenes.</p>

        <title>JA-induced <italic>LeMTS1</italic> expression occurs in trichomes</title>
        <p>Although the presence of terpene synthases in trichomes has been well documented (Bertea et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>; Iijima et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>; Lange et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2000</xref>), the regulation of their expression in trichomes remains obscure. Here we show that JA treatment of intact plants leads to higher transcript levels of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> mainly in trichomes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In contrast, <italic>WIPI-II</italic> expression is induced by JA in the complementary tissues, indicating that there is a tissue-specific differential activation of JA-regulated genes. Basal expression of <italic>WIPI-II</italic> was very low in tomato trichomes, although constitutive expression of a <italic>WIPI-II</italic> in glandular trichomes was recently demonstrated in nightshade (<italic>Solanum americanum</italic>) (Liu et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>). It is unknown whether trichome-expressed <italic>WIPI-II</italic> plays a role in the defense against herbivores. Induction of <italic>WIPI-II</italic> in non-glandular tissue (mesophyll/parenchyma) meets the expectation that it should be present in those cells that suffer from herbivory.</p>
        <p>Previously, JA has been shown to increase trichome density on newly formed leaves of, for instance, Arabidopsis and tomato (Boughton et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>; Traw and Bergelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2003</xref>). Also, JA might induce trichome-based defenses directly. The production of acylsugars on the leaf surface (probably in trichomes) of <italic>Datura wrightii</italic> plants increased without affecting trichome density (Hare and Walling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006</xref>). More clearly, nornicotin production on the <italic>Nicotiana repanda</italic> plant surface increased twofold within 6&#xA0;h of JA treatment (Laue et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2000</xref>). Although it should be kept in mind that in the two above-mentioned studies, it was perhaps unjustly assumed that CHCl<sub>3</sub> or CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> extraction releases only trichome contents, it indicates that trichome-based secondary metabolite biosynthesis can be inducible. Results from our study show, for the first time, a specific transcriptional regulation of a gene involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in trichomes. Isolation of trichomes revealed that linalool synthase expression in tomato trichomes was induced more than twofold by JA after 24&#xA0;h.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we report the identification of the first two monoterpene synthases from a plant of the solanaceae family. As it has recently been described that increased volatile terpene production in transgenic plants can benefit the indirect defense (Kappers et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2005</xref>; Schnee et&#xA0;al. 2006), it will be interesting to investigate the biological effect of <italic>LeMTS1</italic> overexpression in tomato. Furthermore, the role of LeMTS2-derived terpenes in roots and stems remains to be investigated. Finally, the specific induction of LeMTS1 in trichomes by JA can provide an excellent opportunity for identification of novel, JA-related promoter elements, and transcription factors.</p>

The 850&#xA0;bp PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized from leaves of 3-week-old Moneymaker plants and from hypocotyls and roots of 11-week-old Moneymaker plants with a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit, cloned into the Lambda-ACT vector (Elledge et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1991</xref>) and packaged with a ZAP-cDNA Gigapack II gold cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) 200,000 plaques of each library were screenend with the 850&#xA0;bp RT-PCR product as probe, radioactively labeled by the ALL-IN-ONE Random prime labeling method (Sigma, Saint Louis, MI, USA). Filters were hybridized at 55&#xB0;C in BLOTTO hybridization buffer (Sambrook and Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2001</xref>) and washed three times for 10&#xA0;min in 1&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0; SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55&#xB0;C. DNA from positive plaques was converted to pAct2 plasmids and their inserts were sequenced. <italic>LeMTS1</italic> was obtained from the leaf cDNA library, <italic>LeMTS2</italic> from the hypocotyl and root cDNA library. Sequences can be found in Genbank as AY840091 and AY840092, respectively. The presence of plastid targeting signals was predicted using PREDOTAR (http://genoplante-info.infobiogen.fr/predotar/predotar.html; Small et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2004</xref>) and TargetP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/; Emanuelsson et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2000</xref>).</p>

A single colony was grown overnight at 37&#xB0;C on a plate, and transferred to 100&#xA0;ml of LB with ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 37&#xB0;C for 30&#x2013;60&#xA0;min to A<sub>600</sub> of 0.6&#x2013;1.0 before addition of 1&#xA0;mM isopropyl-1-thio-&#x3B2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside and grown at 20&#xB0;C for an additional 8&#xA0;h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 5&#xA0;ml monoterpene synthase assay buffer containing 50&#xA0;mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5&#xA0;mM DTT, 2&#xA0;mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 10&#xA0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, proteinase inhibitor cocktail Complete (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and 1&#xA0;mM ascorbic acid. Cells were disrupted by addition of 1&#xA0;mg/ml lysozym (Sigma), incubation on ice for 30&#xA0;min and sonication. After centrifugation (10,000<italic>g</italic>) for 30&#xA0;min at 4&#xB0;C, 1&#xA0;ml of the soluble enzyme fraction was assayed directly, or after purification of the His-tagged recombinant fusion protein on Ni-agarose beads (Novagen) for monoterpene, sesquiterpene or diterpene synthase activity using 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;M of the substrates GPP, FPP or GGPP, respectively. The assay mix was incubated in a closed 20&#xA0;ml vial at 30&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;h under gentle shaking (150&#xA0;rpm). Reaction products were sampled with a Solid Phase Micro Extraction fiber (SPME) for 10&#xA0;min during which the vial was agitated and heated to 50&#xB0;C. The SPME fiber was desorbed 1&#xA0;min in an Optic injector port (ATAS GL Int., Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) which was kept at 250&#xB0;C.

        <title>Plant treatments, plant headspace sampling, trichome isolation, and measurement of extracts</title>
        <p>For determining tissue specific gene expression, a 13&#xA0;weeks old, untreated tomato plant was dissected to obtain material of each of the described tissues. For separation of trichomes from petioles and stems, 4-week-old plants were used. Trichomes were collected on the bottom of a 50&#xA0;ml tube after vortexing several N<sub>2</sub>(l)-frozen petiole or stem segments, standing in upright position. The trichome fraction was used directly, whereas the remaining cleaned petiole or stem segments were thoroughly brushed to remove all remaining trichome material. Wounding-, spider mite-, and hormone-treatments (for both volatile sampling and gene expression analysis) were done using 3&#x2013;4-week-old tomato plants. Wounding was inflicted by squeezing leaflets several times with a hemostat; a total of 150 spider mites were put on 3&#x2013;4 leaflets per plant for 3&#xA0;days; JA and salicylic acid were applied to plants by spraying 1&#xA0;mM solutions made with tap water containing 0.05% SilwetL-77. Wounding- and hormone-treatments were done (cumulative) at 0&#xA0;h and at 18&#xA0;h and leaves were sampled at 24&#xA0;h. Headspace sampling of plants was performed as described by Kant et&#xA0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>). Tenax sampling tubes were eluted with pentane&#xA0;:&#xA0;diethyl ether (4:1). The Eluted fractions were concentrated 20 times under a stream of N<sub>2</sub> and 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;l was injected into the GC injector port. For root-, leaf-, trichome-, stem- or petiole-extracts, 0.5&#xA0;g tissue was used. The amount of trichome material was adjusted to be equivalent to the trichomes present on 0.5&#xA0;g of the original stem or petiole. Tissues were ground in N<sub>2</sub>(l) and transferred to glass 20&#xA0;ml vials containing 2&#xA0;ml saturated CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5&#xA0;M) buffered in 100&#xA0;mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) which were capped immediately and kept at 5&#xB0;C. Extracts were pre-incubated for 5&#xA0;min at 60&#xB0;C under agitation (500&#xA0;rpm) and sampled for 10&#xA0;min at 60&#xB0;C on a 100&#xA0;&#x3BC;M PDMS SPME fiber (Supelco, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). The SPME fiber was desorbed 1&#xA0;min in the injector port of the GC/MS, which was kept at 250&#xB0;C. GC/MS analysis was done as described earlier (Kant et&#xA0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>).</p>

        <title>Gene expression analysis by RT-PCR and real-time Q-RT-PCR</title>
        <p>For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the tomato RUB1 conjugating enzyme (<italic>RCE1</italic>) was used as constitutively expressed control gene (www.tigr.org: TC153679). Initial PCR was performed with <italic>RCE1</italic> primers, product levels were compared and individual cDNA samples were diluted accordingly, to ensure equal template concentrations. PCRs with primers of genes of interest were subsequently performed for non-saturating number of amplification cycles. <italic>RCE1</italic> primers were always included in each experiment. Used primers (5&#x2032;&#x2013;3&#x2032;) for <italic>RCE1</italic>: forward (F) GATTCTCTCTCATCAATCAATTCG; reverse (R) GCATCCAAACTTTACAGACTCTC, <italic>WIPI-II</italic>: F: GACAAGGTACTAGTAATCAATTATCC; R: CACATAACACACAACTTTGATGCC, <italic>PRP6</italic>: F: TCAGTCCGACTAGGTTGTGG; R: TAGATAAGTGCTTGATGTGCC, <italic>LeMTS1</italic>: F: GATGACATTTATGATGTTTATGGC; R: GGCCATCTCGAGACTTGAGAGCGAATGCAACATTAG, <italic>LeMTS2</italic>: F: GATGACATTTATGATGTTTATGGC; R: GGGTAATAATTCCTTGTCTTATTTC. Expression differences were validated by varying the amount of PCR cycles.</p>
        <p>For real-time Q-RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and DNA was subsequently removed with DNAse (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK). cDNA was synthesized from 5&#xA0;&#x3BC;g RNA using SuperscriptII (Invitrogen) in 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;l reaction volume that was diluted to 50&#xA0;&#x3BC;l prior to using it for PCR. PCRs were performed in the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG kit (Invitrogen). About 20&#xA0;&#x3BC;l PCR reactions contained 0.25&#xA0;&#x3BC;M of each primer, 0.1&#xA0;&#x3BC;l ROX reference dye, and 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;l template. The cycling program was set to 2&#xA0;min 50&#xB0;C, 5&#xA0;min 95&#xB0;C, 40&#xA0;cycles of 15&#xA0;s at 95&#xB0;C and 1&#xA0;min 60&#xB0;C, and a melting curve analysis. Primer pairs were tested for specificity and for linearity with a standard cDNA dilution curve. Primers used: <italic>LeRCE1</italic> QF: 5&#x2032;-GATTCTCTCTCATCAATCAATTCG-3&#x2032; QR: 5&#x2032;-GAACGTAAATGTGCCACCCATA-3&#x2032;, <italic>LeWIPI2</italic> (K03291) QF: 5&#x2032;-GACAAGGTACTAGTAATCAATTATCC-3&#x2032; QR: 5&#x2032;-GGGCATATCCCGAACCCAAGA-3&#x2032;, <italic>LeMTS1</italic> (AY840091) QF: 5&#x2032;-TTTGGGGACATCTTCGGATGAA-3&#x2032; QR: 5&#x2032;-CTACTCGAGTTACTTGAGAGCGAATGCAAC-3&#x2032;.
