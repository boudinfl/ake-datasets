      <abstract>
        <p>Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family are key signaling proteins in the induction and regulation of angiogenesis, both during development and in pathological conditions. However, signaling mediated through VEGF family proteins and their receptors has recently been shown to have direct effects on neurons and glial cells. In the present study, we immunocytochemically investigated the expression and cellular distribution of VEGFA, VEGFB, and their associated receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIB from patients with medically intractable epilepsy. Histologically normal temporal cortex and perilesional regions displayed neuronal immunoreactivity (IR) for VEGFA, VEGFB, and VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2), mainly in pyramidal neurons. Weak IR was observed in blood vessels and there was no notable glial IR within the grey and white matter. In all FCD specimens, VEGFA, VEGFB, and both VEGF receptors were highly expressed in dysplastic neurons. IR in astroglial and balloon cells was observed for VEGFA and its receptors. VEGFR-1 displayed strong endothelial staining in FCD. Double-labeling also showed expression of VEGFA, VEGFB and VEGFR-1 in cells of the microglia/macrophage lineage. The neuronal expression of both VEGFA and VEGFB, together with their specific receptors in FCD, suggests autocrine/paracrine effects on dysplastic neurons. These autocrine/paracrine effects could play a role in the development of FCD, preventing the death of abnormal neuronal cells. In addition, the expression of VEGFA and its receptors in glial cells within the dysplastic cortex indicates that VEGF-mediated signaling could contribute to astroglial activation and associated inflammatory reactions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family includes seven members which are structurally homologous, but display molecular and functional diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. VEGFA, the most well known member of the VEGF family, is a crucial regulator of angiogenesis and vascular permeability in both physiological and pathological conditions such as tumor growth, chronic inflammation, and ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition to the unquestioned role in angiogenesis, it has recently been shown that VEGFA has direct trophic effects on neuronal and glial cells in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p>
      <p>VEGFB is most closely related to VEGFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]; however, the biological function of VEGFB is less well characterized than the function of VEGFA. VEGFB is expressed early during development and appears to have prominent expression in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Additionally, VEGFB has been shown to function as an angiogenic and neuroprotective protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and recent evidence suggests a role for VEGFB in neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p>
      <p>The diverse functions of VEGF proteins can be explained by their differential binding to signaling VEGF receptors [VEGFRs; VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (Flk1/KDR), and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]]. VEGFA binds to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, whereas VEGFB binds specifically to VEGFR-1 and not to VEGFR-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p>
      <p>The VEGF-signaling pathway, involving both neuronal and glial cells, has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including neurodegeneration, stroke, and cerebral and spinal trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, expression of VEGFA is upregulated in neuronal and glial cells after epileptic seizures in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], suggesting a role for VEGFA in seizure disorders. A recent study points to a neuroprotective role for VEGFA following status epilepticus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The relevance of these findings in animal models to human epileptic disorders is uncertain. Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), we recently identified the <italic>VEGFB</italic> gene to be upregulated in human tissue from a patient with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and intractable epilepsy compared to control cortex (Boer et al., unpublished observations). Upregulation of VEGFA and its receptor has also been recently shown in the hippocampus of cases of human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, the distribution of VEGFA, VEGFB, and VEGFRs in epilepsy-associated human malformations of cortical development has not yet been defined.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we investigated the expression of both VEGFA and VEGFB and their receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) in patients with FCD, which is a developmental disorder known to be a major cause of intractable epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. We report the specific cellular distribution, including both the neuronal and the glial components of the dysplastic cortex, and we discuss the potential role of VEGFA, VEGFB, and their receptors in the histogenesis and epileptogenesis of this developmental lesion.</p>

        <p>The cases included in this study were obtained from the databases of the Departments of Neuropathology of the Academic Medical Center (University of Amsterdam; UVA) in Amsterdam and the University Medical Center in Utrecht (UMCU). We examined surgically resected tissue from nine patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for focal cortical dysplasia. Informed consent was obtained for the use of brain tissue and for access to medical records for research purposes. The tissue was obtained and used in a manner compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
        <p>The classification system proposed by Palmini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] was used for grading the degree of FCD and only patients with FCD type IIB located in the temporal lobe were included. The clinical characteristics derived from the patient&#x2019;s medical records are summarized in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The predominant type of seizure pattern was that of complex partial seizures, which were resistant to maximal doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenytoin, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and clonazepam). Information concerning the exact time of last seizure occurrence prior to surgical resection was not available. However, all the patients included in our series did not have seizure activity in the last 24&#xA0;h before surgery. The patients underwent presurgical evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Intraoperative ECoG was performed routinely in all operations for tailoring of surgery and we classified the post-operative seizure outcome according to Engel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 9&#xA0;years.

        <p>Normal-appearing control cortex/white matter from temporal region was obtained at autopsy from five adult control patients (male/female: 2/3; mean age 42, range 17&#x2013;55) without history of neurological diseases. All autopsies were performed within 12&#xA0;h after death (post mortem delay: 11, 11.5, 9, 8.5, 6). The cause of death was represented by acute myocardial infarction. In addition, four of the nine FCD cases contained sufficient amount of perilesional zone (normal-appearing cortex/white matter adjacent to the lesion), for comparison with the autopsy specimens. This material represents good disease control tissue, since it is exposed to the same seizure activity, drugs, fixation time, and the age and gender are also the same.</p>

        <title>Tissue preparation</title>
        <p>Tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Two representative paraffin blocks per case (containing the complete lesion or the largest part of the lesion resected at surgery) were sectioned, stained, and assessed. Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned at 6&#xA0;&#x3BC;m, mounted on organosilane-coated slides (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and used for histological and immunocytochemical reactions as described below. Frozen tissue from control cortex and FCD tissue, stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C, was used for western blot analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Antibody characterization</title>
        <p>To document the presence of a heterogeneous population of cells, we used the following antibodies: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; polyclonal rabbit, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark; 1:4,000; monoclonal mouse, DAKO; 1:50), vimentin (mouse clone V9, DAKO; 1:1,000), MAP2 (polyclonal rabbit; Chemicon; 1:500), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN; mouse clone MAB377, Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA; 1:2,000), non-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI311; Sternberger monoclonals, Lutherville, MD; 1:1,000), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP, -DQ, -DR (CR3/43; monoclonal mouse, DAKO; 1:400), CD68 (mouse clone PG-M1, DAKO; 1:200) and CD31 (mouse clone JC70A, DAKO; 1:100).</p>
        <p>For the detection of VEGFA, VEGFB, and their receptors, the following antibodies (Abs) were used: VEGFA (G153-694, monoclonal mouse; recognizing VEGF 165 and 189 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], Pharmingen, CA, USA; 1:100), VEGFA (A-20, SC-152, polyclonal rabbit; raised against the N-terminus of VEGFA, recognizing VEGF 121, 165 and 189, Santa Cruz Bio., CA, USA; 1:100), VEGFB (H-70, SC-13083, polyclonal rabbit; raised against amino acids 1&#x2013;70 of human VEGFB, Santa Cruz Bio.; 1:20), Flt-1 (VEGFR-1; C-17, SC-316, polyclonal rabbit, Santa Cruz Bio.; 1:100), Flk-1 (VEGFR-2; A-3, SC-6251, monoclonal mouse; Santa Cruz Bio.; 1:100). To allow comparative analysis, we used on frozen specimens of normal (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;3) and FCD tissue (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;2), two additional antibodies (which are not suitable for staining paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue): VEGFR-1 (clone Flt-19, 1:400; developed against the recombinant human extracellular domain of VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2 (clone KDR-1, 1:400; developed against the recombinant human extracellular domain of VEGFR-2), kindly provided by Dr. H. A. Weich (National Research Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany), and previously characterized on human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Similar immunoreactivity patterns were observed on paraffin-embedded and frozen tissue.</p>
        <p>The specificity of the antibodies used for immunocytochemistry on paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2; Santa Cruz Bio.), was further tested by performing western blot analysis of total homogenates of human control cortex. We also include one FCD case of which sufficient frozen material for blot analysis was available (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). VEGFR1 and VEGFR-2 receptor proteins were detectable as a band of approximately 180 and 200&#xA0;kDa, respectively; VEGFB was detectable as a band of approximately 40&#xA0;kDa; VEGFA labeled a prominent band at approximately 48&#xA0;kDa and a light band at 21&#xA0;kDa (reducing conditions), as recently reported in human brain tissue (control hippocampus and FCD; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]). All immunoreactive bands disappeared after preadsorption with the corresponding peptide.

        <p>For immunoblot analysis, human normal cortex (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;3) and FCD (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;1) samples were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 10&#xA0;mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150&#xA0;mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, Na-orthevanadate (10.4&#xA0;mg/ml), 5&#xA0;mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 5&#xA0;mM NaF, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Non-reducing conditions were used to improve the detection of the VEGFA antibody, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For electrophoresis, equal amounts of proteins (30&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/lane) were separated by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis in 7.5&#x2013;12.5% gels. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper for 1&#xA0;h and 30&#xA0;min, using a semi-dry electroblotting system (BioRad, Transblot SD, Hercules, CA, USA). Blots were incubated overnight in TTBS (20&#xA0;mM Tris , 150&#xA0;mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.5)/5% non-fat dry milk, containing the primary antibody (VEGFA, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2, 1:1,000; VEGFB, 1:200). After several washes in TTBS, the membranes were incubated in TTBS/5% non-fat dry milk/1% BSA, containing the goat anti-rabbit coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,500; Dako, Denmark) for 1&#xA0;h. After washes in TTBS, immunoreactivity was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Expression of &#x3B2;-actin (monoclonal mouse, Sigma, St Louis, MO; 1:50,000) was used as reference protein. Because of the limited availability of frozen material from FCD cases, a complete analysis with statistical comparison between control and FCD by immunoblot could not be performed.</p>

        <p>Sections were deparaffinized, re-hydrated, and incubated for 20&#xA0;min in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>diluted in methanol to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation for 10&#xA0;min at 121&#xB0;C in citrate buffer (0.01&#xA0;M, pH 6.0); sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 30&#xA0;min in 10% normal goat serum (Harlan Sera-Lab, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK). We incubated the sections with the primary antibodies overnight at 4&#xB0;C. Hereafter, sections were washed in PBS and we used the ready-for-use Powervision peroxidase system (Immunologic, Duiven, The Netherlands) and 3,3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine as chromogen to develop the staining. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Sections incubated without the primary antibody and excess of the antigenic peptide were essentially blank.</p>
        <p>For double-labeling studies, after incubation overnight at 4&#xB0;C with the primary antibodies, sections were incubated for 2&#xA0;h at RT with Alexa Fluor<sup>&#xAE;</sup> 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor<sup>&#xAE;</sup> 488 anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000; Molecular Probes, The Netherlands). The VEGFR-2 antibody (monoclonal mouse) could only be combined with MAP2 and GFAP (polyclonal rabbit). Sections were analyzed by means of a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; MRC1024) equipped with an argon-ion laser.</p>

          <p>As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], a semi-quantitative analysis was done using an Olympus microscope and examining in each section, high-power non overlapping fields (of 0.0655&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;0.0655&#xA0;mm width, each corresponding to 4.290&#xA0;&#x3BC;m<sup>2</sup>), defined in the center of the lesion using a square grid inserted into the eyepiece. A total microscopical area of 858.050&#xA0;&#x3BC;m<sup>2</sup> was assessed per case. Neuronal cell bodies were differentiated from glia and glia-neuronal balloon cells on the basis of morphology. Balloon cells have eccentric nuclei and ballooned opalescent eosinophilic cytoplasm. The staining intensity was evaluated using a semi-quantitative three-point scale where immunoreactivity was defined as: &#x2212; absent (0); + moderate (1); ++ strong staining (2); intensity score (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This score represents the predominant cell staining intensity found in each section for the different cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglial cells, and balloon cells) as averaged from the selected fields (as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]).

All TLE cases showed VEGFA expression in pyramidal neurons and granule cells of the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, immunocytochemical analysis of the temporal cortex and the FCD cases was not performed.</p>
        <p>The molecular mechanism underlying the induction of VEGFA expression after seizures remains unclear. One possible mechanism, which has been proposed to explain the association between seizure activity and the induction of VEGFA expression, is represented by the stabilization of the hypoxia inducible factor-1&#x3B1; (HIF-1&#x3B1;). HIF-1&#x3B1; is a transcription factor which upregulates VEGFA transcription under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Hypoxia may occur during seizures, representing an important trigger in the induction of VEGFA expression, particularly in case of long lasting seizures, such as in status epilepticus models. However, VEGFA expression is already induced after acute seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and the mechanisms that regulate VEGFA expression are complex. Several transcription factors, including AP-1, HIF-1&#x3B1;, and NF-&#x3BA;B, have been identified to regulate VEGFA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and recently it has also been shown that inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1&#x3B2; (IL-1&#x3B2;), activate <italic>HIF1&#x3B1;</italic> and <italic>VEGFA</italic> gene expression in primary human astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and related molecules has been reported in both animal models and human epilepsy-associated pathologies, including FCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In addition, VEGFA has been demonstrated to be a key mediator of the inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Thus, we might speculate that the prominent expression of VEGFA within the dysplastic cortex could be a critical component of the complex cascade of events leading to a chronic inflammatory state and the sustained seizure activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. With respect to inflammation, inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, can also release various angiogenic cytokines including VEGFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Accordingly, we observed expression of both VEGFA and VEGFB in macrophages (CD68-positive cells), as previously shown in animal models of brain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
        <p>VEGFA effects can also compromise the integrity of the blood&#x2013;brain barrier (BBB; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). Interestingly, alterations of the BBB permeability have been recently observed in both human and experimental temporal lobe epilepsy with positive correlation between the increased vascular permeability and the occurrence of spontaneous seizures in chronic epileptic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p>
        <p>In contrast, several studies highlight a dichotomous function of VEGFA, also demonstrating a neuroprotective role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Administration of VEGFA and neuronal expression of VEGFA have been shown to stimulate neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, it has been suggested that the neuroprotective effects of VEGFA are mediated by the neuronal VEGFR-2 and the subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p>
        <p>VEGFB expression is not induced by hypoxia or several transcription factors known to regulate VEGFA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], as the promoter region of VEGFB lacks HIF-1 and AP-1 sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The regulation of the expression of VEGFB remains unknown. Since all cases examined were associated with epilepsy, we cannot exclude that chronic seizure activity could also contribute to the VEGFB expression in FCD specimens. Alternatively, since VEGFB expression has been shown to be prominent during early brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the strong neuronal expression of VEGFB could represent an intrinsic and immature feature of the dysplastic neuronal cells that could contribute to their survival. Recent studies using VEGFB knock-out mice demonstrate a neurotrophic and neuroprotective activity of VEGFB, exerting a direct action on neurons, and promoting neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p>
        <p>This is an observational study and we were, therefore, not able to investigate the spatio-temporal regulation of the VEGF system. Further research in animal models of cortical dysplasia is clearly needed to elucidate the role of VEGFs and their signaling pathways in the histogenesis or epileptogenesis of developmental disorders.</p>

        <title>Expression of VEGF receptors in normal temporal cortex</title>
        <p>In histologically normal temporal cortex (autopsy and perilesional zone), VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 showed a similar pattern of expression, with weak to moderate immunostaining in pyramidal neurons. Neuronal expression of VEGFRs&#x2019; mRNA and protein has been reported in adult human and rodent brain, with strong expression in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In agreement with these studies, we did not detect glial VEGFR expression in histologically normal cortex and only weak VEGFR expression was observed in endothelial cells.</p>

        <title>Differential cellular distribution of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 in FCD</title>
        <p>Consistent expression of both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was detected within the dysplastic cortex of patients with FCD. Both receptors were upregulated in dysplastic neurons. Increased expression of the VEGFRs and, in particular VEGFR-1, was observed in reactive astrocytes. Upregulation of VEGFRs in neurons and reactive astrocytes has been shown in several other pathological conditions including ischemia, neurodegenerative diseases, and trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Recently, increased expression of VEGFR-2 has been shown in several cases of TLE, including two cases of cortical dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated expression only in endothelial cells, whereas neuronal VEGFR-2 IR was not detected in either control hippocampus or TLE specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Differences in the phenotypes of cells expressing VEGFRs have been observed in several other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. These discrepancies may be caused by differences in experimental methods, tissue processing, or the use of different antibodies that recognize different epitopes.</p>
        <p>Our results support the neuronal expression of VEGFR-2 recently reported in human brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The similar expression pattern of VEGFA and VEGFR-2, with prominent neuronal IR, suggests autocrine/paracrine effects on dysplastic neurons, supporting the hypothesis of a mechanism to protect abnormal neurons from cell death associated with seizures. Autocrine and/or paracrine effects of VEGFA are supported by the observation that administration of VEGFA has been shown to induce mRNA and protein expression of both receptors in adult rat brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. A protective mechanism of VEGFA has been suggested in epileptic rats, showing that VEGFA may reduce spontaneous discharges in epileptic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, upregulation of VEGFA could represent an endogenous compensatory mechanism to reduce excitability and to prevent cell loss after severe seizures. Accordingly, infusion of VEGFA into the hippocampus has been shown to protect against neuronal cell loss after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
        <p>In the present study, we also provide evidence for the expression of VEGFR-1 in activated cells of the microglia/macrophage lineage, which have been shown to be present in FCD specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is in agreement with previous in vitro and in vivo studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] showing VEGFR-1 expression in activated microglial cells. These observations suggest that the microglia/macrophage lineage is also a target for VEGF, which may affect chemotaxis and proliferation of these cells, contributing to the inflammatory state in the epileptic brain.</p>
        <p>There is substantial information about the function and the signaling through VEGFR-2; in contrast, signaling through VEGFR-1 remains poorly understood and has been a matter of discussion. A decoy role has been proposed for VEGFR-1, but more recently, functional signaling via VEGFR-1 has been reported (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]). These observations may give rise to new therapeutic strategies focusing on VEGFR-1 specific ligands, such as VEGFB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
        <p>Although a rapid induction of VEGF and its receptors has been shown in different experimental models of seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], seizures alone cannot account for changes in neuronal and glial expression in FCD since perilesional tissue was exposed to seizures but did not show significant upregulation of VEGFs and/or VEGFRs. Therefore, the lesion per se or the concomitant presence of the lesion and the epileptic activity, are likely to play a role in modulating the VEGF system in these developmental disorders.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Our observed cellular distribution of VEGFA, VEGFB, and their signaling receptors indicate that different cellular components of FCD are involved in VEGF-signaling. In this context, future studies, using both in vivo and in vitro models, will be important to achieve a better understanding of the role of the VEGF-mediated pathways in the histogenesis and epileptogenesis of developmental lesions associated with intractable chronic epilepsy. Presently, signaling via VEGF receptors is not targeted by existing therapies in epileptic patients, but it can be potentially useful in view of its involvement in the regulation of neurogenesis, inflammation, and BBB integrity. However, an effective therapeutic intervention based on modulation of the VEGF system has to take into consideration the specific role of VEGFA and VEGFB and the multiple effects (protective and/or detrimental) reported for VEGFA.</p>
