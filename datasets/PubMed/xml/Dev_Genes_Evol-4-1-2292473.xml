        <p>The remarkable conservation of Hox clusters is an accepted but little understood principle of biology. Some organizational constraints have been identified for vertebrate Hox clusters, but most of these are thought to be recent innovations that may not apply to other organisms. Ironically, many model organisms have disrupted Hox clusters and may not be well-suited for studies of structural constraints. In contrast, the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, which has a long history in Hox gene research, is thought to have a more ancestral-type Hox cluster organization. Here, we demonstrate that the <italic>Tribolium</italic> homeotic complex (HOMC) is indeed intact, with the individual Hox genes in the expected colinear arrangement and transcribed from the same strand. There is no evidence that the cluster has been invaded by non-Hox protein-coding genes, although expressed sequence tag and genome tiling data suggest that noncoding transcripts are prevalent. Finally, our analysis of several mutations affecting the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC suggests that intermingling of enhancer elements with neighboring transcription units may constrain the structure of at least one region of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> cluster. This work lays a foundation for future studies of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC that may provide insights into the reasons for Hox cluster conservation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hox clusters arose near the origins of the animal kingdom (Larroux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>; Ryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2007</xref>). The last common ancestor of the protostomes and deuterostomes is thought to have had a cluster of at least seven genes characterized by a common transcriptional orientation and by colinearity in the order of the genes and their expression domains along the anterior&#x2013;posterior axis (reviewed in Garcia-Fernandez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>In various metazoan lineages, Hox clusters have gained or lost genes by duplication and deletion but often have maintained their chromosomal order, transcriptional orientation, and both spatial and temporal colinearity of expression patterns (reviewed in Ferrier and Minguillon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>), suggesting that Hox cluster organization has been subject to strong constraints during evolution. Classical model systems, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, have provided many important insights into the developmental functions of Hox genes but do not provide particularly good examples of Hox cluster conservation. The Hox cluster of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is split into two parts (the Antennapedia (ANTC) and bithorax (BXC) complexes), shows changes in transcriptional orientation of some genes, and includes interspersed genes of independent origin as well as Hox-derived genes that have evolved novel developmental roles (reviewed in Ferrier and Minguillon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>). These alterations suggest that the constraints keeping the Hox cluster intact may have been lost in the lineage leading to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Additional Hox cluster rearrangements (breaks, microinversions, and gene transpositions) have been found in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (Negre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>; Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>; Von Allmen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1996</xref>) as well as in the silk moth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (Yasukochi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2004</xref>). The Hox genes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (reviewed in Aboobaker and Blaxter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>) and the tunicate <italic>Oikopleura dioica</italic> (Seo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2004</xref>) have undergone even more extreme loss and rearrangement such that none of their remaining Hox genes are clustered. In most cases, the Hox genes of these organisms still show spatial but not temporal colinearity. Rapid development seems to be the common denominator among most of these organisms, perhaps making temporal colinearity of Hox genes unnecessary, or even undesirable (Ferrier and Holland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>; Ferrier and Minguillon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>; Negre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>While studies of disrupted Hox clusters have provided some insights into Hox cluster maintenance, a more complete understanding will require analysis of organisms where they are still intact. Studies of vertebrate Hox clusters have uncovered several potential mechanisms that may promote temporal colinearity and therefore constrain the organization of these clusters (reviewed in Kmita and Duboule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2003</xref>). These include progressive changes in chromatin state along the length of the cluster, varying affinity of regulatory elements to a gradient of signal, and the presence of global enhancer elements outside the cluster that regulate multiple genes within the cluster. However, it is not clear whether these mechanisms apply to other organisms.</p>
      <p>Duboule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>) has suggested that the modern vertebrate Hox clusters are actually more organized than the ancestral cluster. Some of the mechanisms constraining the organization of vertebrate Hox clusters likely evolved concomitant with the co-option of Hox genes for functions such as limb development (Duboule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Kmita and Duboule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2003</xref>) and, therefore, may not be applicable to other lineages. Based on this model, we might expect to gain a better understanding of the ancestral constraints on Hox clusters by studying a less organized but still intact cluster. Such clusters have been described in organisms as diverse as the cephalochordate amphioxus (Garcia-Fernandez and Holland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1994</xref>; Minguillon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2005</xref>), sea urchins (Cameron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>), and the insects <italic>Apis</italic> (Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; Dearden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>) and <italic>Anopheles</italic> (Holt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2002</xref>; Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>). Evidence also suggests that the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, has an intact Hox cluster. Conventional cloning and sequencing of the portion of the cluster corresponding to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Antennapedia complex has shown that this region of the homeotic complex (HOMC) is intact in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). Genetic mapping also suggests that the integrity of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster has been maintained (Beeman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1987</xref>). Moreover, the genetic methodologies possible with <italic>Tribolium</italic>, as well as the application of RNAi, have provided a comprehensive description of the full repertoire of Hox genes and their functions (e.g., Beeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>; Beeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1989</xref>; Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>; Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2000</xref>; Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2006</xref>; Stuart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1991</xref>; Stuart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1993</xref>; Tomoyasu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2005</xref>). The <italic>Tribolium</italic> genome has recently been sequenced, giving us the opportunity to explore the structure of its Hox cluster in detail. Here, we present an analysis of several Hox mutations along with the transcriptional profile of the cluster during embryonic development. We discuss these results with respect to potential mechanisms of Hox cluster organization and constraint.</p>

        <p>Sequence for the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC was taken from the Tcas_2.0 Baylor HSGC assembly. The tiled region consists of &#x223C;810,000 bases from LG2 (2,290,000 to 301,000) stretching between the two non-Hox genes flanking the complex. NimbelGen designed &#x223C;50&#xA0;mer oligos covering this region at two densities: (1) one feature per 91&#xA0;bp and (2) one feature per 70&#xA0;bp. An additional region spanning 5&#xA0;kb on either side of the putative homolog of <italic>dme-miR-iab-4</italic> was tiled at a higher density of one feature every 10&#xA0;bp. Visualization and scaling of tiling data was performed using Integrated Genome Browser (Affymetrix, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/developer/tools/download_igb.affx">http://www.affymetrix.com/support/developer/tools/download_igb.affx</ext-link>).</p>
        <p><italic>Tribolium</italic> 0&#x2013;72-h-old embryos, grown at 30&#xB0;C in standard media, were collected by sieving, dechorionated for 2&#xA0;min in 100% bleach, and homogenized in 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of Trizol using a teflon pestle. Total RNA was then extracted using the standard Trizol protocol (Invitrogen). dsDNA was prepared from &#x223C;10&#xA0;&#x3BC;g of total RNA with random hexamers according to Kapranov et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2002</xref>), with the following modifications. Primers were annealed using a 20-min ramp to 15&#xB0;C, and the first strand reaction was not subdivided for second strand synthesis. The resulting cDNA was used as template by NimbelGen for labeling and hybridization (Squazzo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2006</xref>).</p>

        <title>The <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster has retained an ancestral organization</title>
        <p>Several bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones encompassing the ANTC-like region of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster were previously sequenced and annotated (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). Using the newly assembled <italic>Tribolium</italic> genome sequence, we have performed a similar analysis of the BXC-like portion of the cluster and find that this region contains the <italic>Tribolium</italic> orthologs of <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>; Bennett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999</xref>), <italic>abdominal-A</italic> (<italic>abd-A</italic>; Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1998</xref>) and <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>). As in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the transcription units in this part of the complex are larger than those of the ANTC-like portion due to the presence of longer introns.</p>
        <p>As expected from previous molecular and genetic studies (Beeman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1987</xref>; Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>), all of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox genes map to a single cluster on LG2. This cluster spans approximately 756&#xA0;Kb within a single scaffold of the assembled genome sequence. A few small sequencing gaps are present in the assembly, but more than half can be filled by other available sequences (i.e., the three BAC clones previously sequenced for the ANTC-like portion of the cluster and four BACs from the BXC-like region sequenced for verification of the shotgun genome assembly; <italic>Tribolium</italic> Genome Consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2008</xref>). The total length of the filled gaps is approximately 2,635&#xA0;bp (mismatches in the sequence flanking the gaps lead to some ambiguity), which is only slightly longer than the estimated total length of these gaps (1,938&#xA0;bp). Thus, estimation of sequencing gaps in the HOMC region appears to be quite accurate.</p>
        <p>Two of these gaps are immediately adjacent to transposable element insertion sites and may result from difficulties in assembling repetitive DNA. These two sites account for about 1,300&#xA0;bp of the total gaps in the HOMC. In two other cases, gaps in the genome assembly are associated with tandem duplications that are not present in the BAC assemblies: an approximately 160-bp duplication between <italic>Tc-Deformed</italic> (<italic>Tc-Dfd</italic>) and <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> and an approximately 8.5-kb duplication between <italic>prothoraxless</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antennapedia</italic> (<italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic>) and <italic>Tc-fushi tarazu</italic> (<italic>Tc-ftz</italic>). We designed primers to amplify across the regions in question using Ga-2 genomic DNA (the same inbred strain that was used for the <italic>Tribolium</italic> genome sequence). In both cases, the size of the resulting fragment is consistent with that predicted from the BAC sequence (data not shown), suggesting that these gaps and duplications are artifacts of the genome assembly process. It is important to note that these artifacts affect only a small fraction of the HOMC sequence, but they underscore the increased quality of finished versus draft sequences.</p>
        <p>The single <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster contains orthologs of all eight <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox genes, as well as orthologs of the Hox-derived genes, <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> and <italic>zerkn&#xFC;llt</italic> (<italic>zen</italic>; <italic>Tribolium</italic> Genome Consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2008</xref> and Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). (In the case of <italic>zen</italic>, <italic>Tribolium</italic> has two paralogs apparently resulting from a recent duplication in the beetle lineage, independent of the <italic>zen</italic> duplication that occurred in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>)). These genes are arranged in the same order on the chromosome as their counterparts in other insects. As in <italic>Apis</italic> (Dearden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>; Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>), but in contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> (Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>), the Hox and Hox-derived genes in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> cluster are all oriented in the same direction (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, the two miRNA genes (<italic>miR-10</italic> and <italic>miR-iab-4</italic>) that have been described in other insect Hox clusters are found at conserved positions in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC (Tanzer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2005</xref> and Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

        <p>The ANTC and BXC clusters of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> contain a number of non-Hox, protein-coding genes. In contrast, there is no evidence for non-Hox, protein-coding genes in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC (The <italic>Tribolium</italic> Genome Consortium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2008</xref>). Here, we corroborate those findings by using several methods to address whether unrelated genes might be interspersed among the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox genes. First, we searched the <italic>Tribolium</italic> genome for orthologs of genes that are located within the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> clusters and determined that none of these genes are located within the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC. Second, we analyzed predicted proteins within the region to determine whether any of them have recognizable orthologs in other species. Other than the Hox and Hox-derived genes, we found no evolutionarily conserved proteins among either the GLEAN predictions or the GNOMON ab initio predictions that map to the Hox cluster. Third, we searched a collection of <italic>Tribolium</italic> ESTs for expressed sequences within the HOMC. By this approach, we identified three non-Hox EST clusters that appear to represent noncoding transcripts as well as evidence for a mariner transposase gene (see below), but no other protein-coding genes were found. Finally, we analyzed the embryonically transcribed sequences identified by a tiling array to determine if any were likely to encode proteins. Again, we found no evidence of non-Hox-related protein-coding genes other than those within transposable elements. Although there are caveats to these analyses (e.g., gene prediction methods are imperfect, the tiling array represents only the embryonic transcriptome and EST coverage is incomplete), our results strongly suggest that the protein-coding genes in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox complex (excluding genes within transposable elements) are all either Hox or Hox-derived genes.</p>
        <p>Comparison of transposable element density in the Hox complexes of various animals has led to the suggestion that higher abundance of transposable elements in Hox clusters is correlated with loss of structural integrity. Mammalian Hox complexes have a reduced number of transposons compared to other regions of the genome (Ferrier and Minguillon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>). Moreover, when transposons are present, they seem to be preferentially inserted into nontranscribed regions of the clusters (Mainguy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>). In contrast, transposons occur fairly frequently in the split <italic>Drosophila</italic> clusters (Fried et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>). Though the prediction of three transposable elements in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox complex (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) may be an underestimate, the same method predicts fivefold more in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox clusters. Additionally, only three transposable elements (all mariners) have been found in the larger but intact <italic>Apis</italic> Hox complex (Dearden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). These numbers are consistent with the apparent inverse correlation between transposon number and the level of Hox cluster organization.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these observations suggest that with respect to gene content, order, and orientation, the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster closely resembles the putative ancestral Hox cluster (Garcia-Fernandez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). Thus, the constraints preserving the integrity of the Hox cluster may still be in force in <italic>Tribolium</italic>.</p>
        <p>To determine whether these constraints extend outside the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster, we examined synteny beyond the cluster itself. As previously described, <italic>Tc-chaoptic</italic> partially overlaps the 3&#x2032; UTR of <italic>Tc-labial</italic> (<italic>Tc-lab</italic>) on the opposite strand (Nie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>). Working outward, the first gene on the same strand as the Hox genes is <italic>Tc_00927</italic>, a dolichyl glycosyltransferase orthologous to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CG4542. Beyond the <italic>Tc-Abd-B</italic> locus is a cluster of putative serine carboxypeptidase genes (<italic>Tc_00887</italic>, <italic>Tc_00664</italic>, <italic>Tc_00665</italic>, and <italic>Tc_00666</italic>) and the ortholog of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CG3909 (<italic>Tc_00886</italic>). We identified the orthologs of these genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, and <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and determined their map positions. None of these genes map near the Hox cluster in any of the other insects. Likewise, orthologs of the genes adjacent to <italic>lab</italic> and <italic>Abd-B</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> do not map near the Hox clusters of the other three insects. These results suggest that the constraints preserving the Hox cluster act only on the Hox genes themselves and not the surrounding region.</p>

        <title>The <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster produces numerous noncoding transcripts</title>
        <p>We developed a tiling microarray covering the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox complex to identify the transcription units active during a broad window of <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic development. Tiling array signal intensity profiles were compared with previously described Hox cDNA structures. Though the tiling density is not fine-scaled enough to effectively resolve intron&#x2013;exon boundaries, there is a near-perfect correlation between tiling array-predicted transcription and the position of exons in the well-characterized Hox genes. The only caveat is that the 5&#x2032; exons of <italic>maxillopedia</italic>/<italic>Tc-proboscipedia</italic> (<italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic>) and <italic>Tc-Abd-B</italic> exhibit weaker signals than the other exons of these genes. The most likely explanation is that the 5&#x2032; exon is present only in a small subset of the transcripts derived from the gene (i.e., a minor spliceoform).</p>
        <p>During the first 3&#xA0;days of development, numerous regions of the Hox complex, including intergenic and intronic noncoding regions, are actively transcribed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, neither of the two most likely noncoding candidates, the previously described miRNAs, is robustly identified on the tiling array. Transcription at the <italic>tca-miR-10</italic> locus is not detected, and transcription at the <italic>tca-miR-iab-4</italic> locus is weak. It may be that <italic>tca-miR-10</italic> is not expressed during the stages examined, whereas in situ hybridization assays show that <italic>tca-miR-iab-4</italic> is strongly expressed during part of the developmental window examined (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).

        <p>The most intense hybridization signals are detected in the central 250&#xA0;kb of the Hox complex, encompassing the <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Ultrathorax</italic>/<italic>Tc-Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Utx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Ubx</italic>) genes. Strikingly, transcription in this region is almost equally intense for coding and noncoding loci, and for both the introns and exons of the protein-coding genes. There are hundreds of discrete regions (500&#xA0;bp or longer) where signal intensity is many times greater than for verified Hox gene exons. It is not possible to determine from the single time point we have analyzed if any of these discrete regions are part of larger transcripts. To verify that the observed signals in the tiling array represent authentic transcription, RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with a representative 1-kb region between <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Utx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Ubx</italic> (TcNC-1 in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This region is expressed in a Hox-like pattern with distinct anterior and posterior borders in the posterior region of the elongating germ band (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Interestingly, signal is detected primarily in two spots per nucleus, presumably at the sites of nascent transcription. This suggests either rapid degradation or processing of a primary transcript as would be seen for a pri-miRNA or an intron.</p>
        <p>In our search for additional genes within the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster, we identified three ESTs that appear to represent noncoding transcripts. One seems to be a chimeric artifact, arising from the fusion of a <italic>tca-miR-10</italic> precursor and part of a 28s <italic>rRNA</italic> gene. The second, represented by two independent cDNAs, maps between <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Utx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Ubx</italic> while the third is located within the first intron of <italic>Utx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Ubx</italic>. The last two are transcribed from the strand opposite the Hox genes and are correlated with regions of strong signal in the tiling array analysis.</p>

        <p>Because complex regulatory regions may act as a constraining force keeping Hox clusters intact, we analyzed the <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> mutation, which was shown to have unusual effects on the expression of <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> (Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2000</xref>); <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> homozygotes lack most, if not all, normal <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> expression, but both heterozygotes and homozygotes display strong ectopic <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> expression in a pattern reminiscent of <italic>Cephalothorax</italic>/<italic>Tc-Sex combs reduced</italic> (<italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>) expression (albeit with an apparent posterior shift of some domains). This ectopic expression is sufficient to rescue some aspects of <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> function so <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> is not an <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> null (Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2000</xref>). Interestingly, we find that <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> fails to complement a null allele of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> (and, in fact, appears to be null for <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>) but complements null alleles of <italic>Tc-Dfd</italic> and <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> (data not shown).</p>
        <p>To better understand this complex mutation, we characterized the breakpoints associated with <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup>. <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> is associated with a chromosomal rearrangement involving at least four breakpoints. Although we have not ruled out the presence of additional breakpoints, the simplest interpretation of our data is that a fragment of the HOMC (including <italic>Tc-zen1</italic>, <italic>Tc-zen2, Tc-Dfd</italic>, <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>, and <italic>Tc-ftz</italic>) has been removed from the HOMC and inserted between a fragment of LG9 and a non-HOMC fragment of LG2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). This scenario is consistent with previously reported pseudo-linkage of LG2 and LG9 associated with <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> (Beeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>) and provides an explanation for the mid-embryonic lethality of the <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> homozygotes (Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2000</xref>). That is, non-HOMC breakpoints interrupt both the <italic>TFIIA-L</italic> ortholog, which is a component of the transcriptional machinery (Yokomori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1993</xref>), and a homolog of <italic>groucho</italic>, which is an important transcriptional corepressor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Jimenez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1997</xref>; Paroush et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1994</xref>). We conclude that the breakpoint between <italic>Tc-ftz</italic> and <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> is likely to account for the loss of Cx/Tc-Scr function associated with <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup>, probably by separating the <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> transcription unit from some or all of its regulatory units. The rearrangement probably juxtaposes these regulatory elements with the <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> transcription unit, providing a likely explanation for the <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>-like expression of <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> in <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> embryos.

        <title><italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> regulatory elements map near or within <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic></title>
        <p>Beeman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>) observed that mutations in <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> and <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> often partially fail to complement one another. Because this is precisely the type of genetic interaction that would be predicted if the separation of Hox genes has deleterious effects, we decided to analyze <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup>, an allele of <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> that shows such effects. The <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> mutation, which results in transformation of the larval legs toward antennae as well as reductions of some labial and thoracic tissue, has been proposed to be a null allele of <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> (Beeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>). However, adults transheterozygous for <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup>/<italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D2</italic></sup> have a very different phenotype from that produced by larval <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> RNAi (Tomoyasu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2005</xref>) and, instead, resemble adults in which both <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> have been knocked down (Tomoyasu, personal communication). This result raises the possibility that the <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> mutation affects the function of both genes. To address this issue, we performed parental RNAi with <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and found that the resulting larvae (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) show a phenotype almost identical to that of <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> homozygotes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), suggesting that the <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> mutation primarily affects the function of <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> during embryonic development. However, there is a subtle difference between the <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> and <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> RNAi phenotypes in the positioning of the T1 appendages, which are located near the ventral midline in the RNAi larvae but more laterally in the mutants. This difference is likely attributable to partial loss of Cx/Tc-Scr function in <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> because Cx/Scr is responsible for the midline position of the labial appendages in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2006</xref>) and other insects (Hughes and Kaufman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2000</xref>; Pattatucci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1991</xref>; Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1997</xref>). Thus, <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> appears to be not only a null allele of <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> but also a hypomorphic allele of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>.

A <italic>ptl</italic><sup>KT76</sup> larva (<bold>h</bold>) and pupa (<bold>i</bold>) also display EGFP enhancer trap expression in parts of the labial and first thoracic segments</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="427_2008_213_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
        <p>To understand why the <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> mutation affects both <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>, we characterized its mutant lesion(s). We found that <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> is associated with an inversion of about 6.6&#xA0;Mb, with breakpoints in <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and a distant region of LG2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). In addition, there are small deletions at each end of the inversion (approximately 3.1&#xA0;kb of the <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> transcription unit including all of exon 2 and approximately 1.5&#xA0;kb at the other end). Consistent with this conclusion, we find that <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> can act as a crossover suppressor for LG2, reducing recombination between <italic>Reindeer</italic> (a mutation near one end of LG2) and the HOMC from its normal value of 35&#x2013;40&#xA0;cM (Beeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>) to approximately 20&#xA0;cM. These results suggest that breakpoints within the <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> gene affect the function of both <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>, probably by disrupting the function of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> regulatory elements (see &#x201C;<xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>&#x201D;).</p>
        <p>Additional evidence for the presence of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> regulatory elements in the vicinity of <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> comes from a piggyBac-insertion line recovered during an insertional mutagenesis project. The KT076 line carries a homozygous lethal insertion in the last intron of <italic>ptl</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Crosses between KT076 heterozygotes produce a class of embryos (putative homozygotes) with the T1 and T2 legs partially transformed toward antennae (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d), a phenotype consistent with partial loss of Ptl/Tc-Antp function. However, individuals carrying the insertion display an embryonic enhancer trap expression pattern (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f) very similar to the expression pattern of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> (Curtis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>; Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g), despite the fact that the insertion site is about 87&#xA0;kb upstream of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>. KT076 larvae and pupae also show weak enhancer trap patterns consistent with predicted <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> domains (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h&#x2013;i). As expected from the phenotype of homozygotes, KT076 fails to complement <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> as assayed by adult viability, and crosses of KT076 to <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> heterozygotes produce embryos with a phenotype similar to, but slightly weaker than, that of <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> homozygotes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e). In contrast, KT076 fully complements both the embryonic phenotype and the adult viability of <italic>Cx</italic><sup><italic>61</italic></sup>, a null allele of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> (Shippy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2006</xref>), indicating that Cx/Tc-Scr function is not compromised by the insertion (data not shown). These results suggest that KT076 is a hypomorphic allele of <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic>, and it will, hereafter, be referred to as <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>KT76</italic></sup>. Together with the data from the <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> and <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> mutations, the <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>-like enhancer trap phenotype of <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>KT76</italic></sup> provides strong evidence that <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> regulatory elements are located near, and probably within, <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic>. Although additional experiments will be necessary to pinpoint the location of regulatory elements and verify this conclusion, it is intriguing to think that overlap of regulatory elements of one Hox gene with the transcription unit of another Hox gene might be an important mechanism of Hox cluster constraint.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The Hox clusters of several insects have now been completely sequenced. While breaks in the cluster seem to have occurred several times in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage, the clusters <italic>of Apis</italic>, <italic>Anopheles</italic>, and <italic>Tribolium</italic> are intact. This suggests that many insect clusters are still subject to constraints to maintain their organization. Of the insects with intact clusters, <italic>Tribolium</italic> is, by far, the most genetically tractable and has a strong history of Hox gene studies, thus offering the best system for understanding the constraints acting on an intact insect Hox cluster. Below, we discuss insights provided by our analysis of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC into mechanisms that might be responsible for Hox cluster integrity.</p>
      <sec id="Sec17">
        <title>Temporal colinearity</title>
        <p>Among organisms for which both Hox cluster sequence and expression data are available, the presence of an intact cluster appears to be correlated with temporal colinearity of Hox gene expression, while disrupted clusters are associated with lack of temporal colinearity (Monteiro and Ferrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). This observation has pushed temporal colinearity to the forefront of discussions about Hox cluster maintenance. However, several questions remain to be answered. Does temporal colinearity really require an intact Hox cluster? Is temporal colinearity required for proper Hox gene function in organisms with intact clusters? If temporal colinearity is a key constraint on <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster integrity, we might expect rearrangements to affect the function of most or all Hox genes. However, our analysis of <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox cluster mutations provides no evidence for such global effects. The <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> inversion splits the complex into two parts but all of the Hox genes except <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> appear to function normally. In addition, the <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> rearrangement results in the translocation of several HOMC genes (<italic>Tc-zen</italic>, <italic>Tc-Dfd</italic>, <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>, and <italic>Tc-ftz</italic>) to a new chromosomal location. At least one of these genes, <italic>Tc-Dfd</italic>, is functional because <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> fully complements a <italic>Tc-Dfd</italic> null allele. Likewise, the genes remaining in the HOMC (with the exception of <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic>) apparently function normally. These limited effects of Hox cluster rearrangements are similar to what has been reported for <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g., Abbott and Kaufman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1986</xref>; Pultz et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1988</xref>). Although additional experiments will be required to determine whether <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox genes exhibit temporal colinearity, our results suggest that constraints on the <italic>Tribolium</italic> HOMC are more likely to act locally.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec18">
        <title>Regulatory elements</title>
        <p>The reported breaks and transposition sites in the Hox clusters of <italic>Drosophila</italic> species are all located in intergenic regions near the 3&#x2032; end of a gene (Negre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>; Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>) and, thus, are presumably less likely to separate a gene from its regulatory elements, which are predominantly located 5&#x2032; of each Drosophila Hox gene. Interestingly, the one exception to this rule is the region between <italic>abd-A</italic> and <italic>Abd-B</italic>, which contains regulatory regions for both genes and is not split in any of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> species examined so far (Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>). These observations led to the conclusion that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox clusters have a modular organization (with each gene and its regulatory elements representing a separate module) and that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox genes are still partially clustered simply because the regulatory regions are so large that there are relatively few positions where breaks can occur without disturbing a module. That is, most of the remaining linkage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox clusters (with the possible exception of <italic>abd-A and Abd-B</italic>) is due to &#x201C;phylogenetic inertia,&#x201D; and, given enough time, the clusters will completely disperse (Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>The question naturally arises whether phylogenetic inertia could also be the reason for the intact Hox clusters of insects like <italic>Tribolium</italic>. Lewis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>) suggested that unusual features of recombination (Ranz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2001</xref>) may make drosophilids more tolerant of Hox cluster rearrangements than are most insects. If this is the case, intact clusters may just be the consequence of slower rates of chromosomal rearrangement (Negre and Ruiz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2007</xref>). Alternatively, constraints on Hox cluster maintenance may still be functional in <italic>Tribolium</italic>.</p>
        <p>Our analysis of mutant breakpoints in the <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> region indicates that, in at least one case, <italic>Tribolium</italic> Hox genes are not modular. That is, at least some of the regulatory elements controlling <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> expression are apparently located within the <italic>pt</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> gene (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Most embryonic enhancers of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> are predicted to lie between the <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> and <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> breakpoints because the <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> allele appears to lack all Cx/Tc-Scr function, while <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> has almost normal embryonic Cx/Tc-Scr function. This conclusion is further supported by the expression of <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> in a <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic>-like pattern in <italic>mxp</italic><sup><italic>Dch-3</italic></sup> mutants, presumably due to juxtaposition of the <italic>mxp</italic>/<italic>Tc-pb</italic> transcription unit with sequence between <italic>Tc-ftz</italic> and <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic>. Adult <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> regulatory elements are likely located within, or 5&#x2032; of, <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> because the <italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>D60</italic></sup> rearrangement seems to have a stronger effect on the adult functions of Cx/Tc-Scr. The presence of <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> regulatory elements near, or within, <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> is supported by the observation that a <italic>piggyBac</italic> insertion within the <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> transcription unit (<italic>ptl</italic><sup><italic>K76</italic></sup>) shows an enhancer trap phenotype that appears to be driven by <italic>Cx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Scr</italic> regulatory elements.</p>
        <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, elements which drive <italic>Scr</italic>-like expression patterns have been found in the region between <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>Antp</italic> (Gorman and Kaufman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1995</xref>). However, these elements are apparently redundant because breakpoints in this region only slightly reduce <italic>Scr</italic> expression levels within its normal domain. Moreover, a deficiency which removes most, if not all, of the <italic>Antp</italic> transcription unit has no effect on embryonic <italic>Scr</italic> expression. Thus, it is possible that the modularity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox cluster is a recent innovation resulting from changes in the position of cis-regulatory elements. This newly acquired modularity might have allowed breaks in the Hox cluster in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage. In contrast, overlap of regulatory elements with neighboring genes might still act as a constraint on the integrity of the Hox cluster in <italic>Tribolium</italic>.</p>

      <sec id="Sec19">
        <title>Noncoding transcripts</title>
        <p>Although noncoding transcripts within Hox clusters have been recognized for many years (Cumberledge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1990</xref>; Lipshitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1987</xref>; Sanchez-Herrero and Akam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1989</xref>), there has recently been renewed interest in these enigmatic RNAs. At least two of these ncRNAs, <italic>miR-196</italic> and <italic>miR-iab-4</italic>, can have homeotic function and attenuate the actions of protein-coding Hox genes (Hornstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Ronshaugen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to the miRNAs, numerous long noncoding RNAs have been identified within the Hox clusters of both flies and mammals (Bae et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2002</xref>; Rinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2007</xref>). ncRNAs are implicated in a vast array of processes, including regulation of transcription, translation, epigenetic control of chromatin, mono-allelic expression, dosage compensation, and silencing (reviewed in Mattick and Makunin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BXC, these transcripts have been implicated in the control of Hox gene expression, although there is some controversy as to whether they promote (Sanchez-Elsner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2006</xref>) or repress (Petruk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>) Hox gene transcription. Mainguy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>) found evidence for extensive noncoding transcription in the mammalian Hox clusters and proposed that polycistronic and antisense transcription might play a role in keeping Hox genes clustered. Our transcriptional profiling data demonstrates that <italic>Tribolium</italic> also shows considerable noncoding transcription in the Hox complex. While the tiling array has provided a revealing snapshot of transcription levels during embryonic development, much additional work will be necessary to characterize the actual transcripts. For example, the high levels of transcription in the <italic>ptl</italic>/<italic>Tc-Antp</italic> and <italic>Utx</italic>/<italic>Tc-Ubx</italic> regions could be the result of several individual transcripts or one long transcript. Interestingly, dicistronic transcripts spanning the <italic>Antp</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> orthologs have been reported in crustaceans (Shiga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2006</xref>) and centipedes (Brena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). If such transcripts have an important function, they might constrain linkage in at least some parts of the Hox cluster.</p>
        <p>The data available thus far indicate that noncoding transcripts are prevalent in both intact and broken Hox clusters. However, it is not clear whether these transcripts perform the same functions in all organisms. Perhaps, noncoding RNAs play a different or more critical role in organisms with intact clusters. Future studies in this area are likely to provide important insights into Hox gene function and possibly into Hox cluster conservation.</p>
