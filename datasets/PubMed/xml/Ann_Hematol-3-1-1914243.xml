        <p>Clinical resistance to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with the expression of the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins P-glycoprotein, encoded by the <italic>MDR1</italic>/<italic>ABCB1</italic> gene, multidrug resistant-related protein (MRP/ABCC1), the lung resistance-related protein (LRP), or major vault protein (MVP), and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). The clinical value of <italic>MDR1</italic>, <italic>MRP1</italic>, <italic>LRP</italic>/<italic>MVP</italic>, and <italic>BCRP</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was prospectively studied in 154 newly diagnosed AML patients &#x2265;60&#xA0;years who were treated in a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial. Expression of <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>BCRP</italic> showed a negative whereas <italic>MRP1</italic> and <italic>LRP</italic> showed a positive correlation with high white blood cell count (respectively, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001 and <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Higher <italic>BCRP</italic> mRNA was associated with secondary AML (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>BCRP</italic> mRNA were highly significantly associated (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), as were <italic>MRP1</italic> and <italic>LRP</italic> mRNA (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) expression. Univariate regression analyses revealed that CD34 expression, increasing <italic>MDR1</italic> mRNA as well as <italic>MDR1</italic>/<italic>BCRP</italic> coexpression, were associated with a lower complete response (CR) rate and with worse event-free survival and overall survival. When adjusted for other prognostic actors, only CD34-related <italic>MDR1/BCRP</italic> coexpression remained significantly associated with a lower CR rate (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), thereby identifying a clinically resistant subgroup of elderly AML patients.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Clinical resistance to chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is often associated with the expression of (membrane) transport-associated multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins. Expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the <italic>MDR1</italic> gene, is an independent adverse prognostic factor for response and survival in de novo AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that besides P-gp, also the MDR-related protein (MRP1/ABCC1) and the lung resistance-related protein (LRP), also designated as the major vault protein (MVP), are expressed in AML. However, the prognostic significance of the latter resistance proteins has not been settled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some years ago, a new drug resistant protein, i.e., the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), which is the equivalent of the mitoxantrone (MXT) resistant protein and the placental ABC transporter (ABCP), was found to be expressed in AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The precise role of either resistance proteins among poor risk AML such as in patients of older age has not been established. This study prospectively investigated the relevance of <italic>MDR1</italic>, <italic>MRP1</italic>, <italic>LRP</italic>, and <italic>BCRP</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in combination with known prognostic characteristics like CD34 expression, white blood cell (WBC) count, and secondary AML as possible denominators of response and survival in patients with AML aged 60+ who were treated in the same clinical trial.</p>

        <title>Patients</title>
        <p>A group of 154 patients with AML aged 60&#xA0;years or older were included in the present study. All patients were enrolled between May 1997 and February 1999 in an international, multigroup, randomized phase 3 trial performed under auspices of the Dutch&#x2013;Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group and the UK Medical Research Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In that trial, 419 eligible white patients &#x2265;60&#xA0;years with previously untreated de novo and secondary AML (M0&#x2013;M2 and M4&#x2013;M7 according to the French&#x2013;American&#x2013;British [FAB] classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) were randomized to receive two cycles of induction chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (ara-C) with or without the P-gp inhibitor PSC-833 (Valspodar, Amdray&#xAE;; Novartis Pharma, Basle, Switzerland). Patients in both arms in complete remission after these two cycles were to receive one consolidation consisting of ara-C, MXT, and etoposide. Inclusion criteria, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of the phase 3 trial have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
        <p>Bone marrow (BM) aspirates had been collected at diagnosis for the analysis of P-gp function and expression, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Selection of patients for our study was based on availability of sufficient purified AML blast samples in our tissue bank, which was the case for 154 patients.</p>
        <p>This study was approved by the ethics committees of the participating institutions and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before randomization.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>BM aspirates were obtained in heparinized tubes. Mononuclear BM cells were collected by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (density 1.077&#xA0;g/m<sup>3</sup>; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). To obtain purified samples with more than 85% of blasts, T-cell depletion and adherence depletion was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Cells were cryopreserved in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 20% fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco) and stored in liquid nitrogen. On the day of the experiments, BM cells were thawed. Cells were washed and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Before RNA and DNA isolation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco).</p>

        <title>MDR1, MRP1, LRP, and BCRP mRNA analysis</title>
        <p>The drug resistance proteins were analyzed using the methods that we previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In brief, total RNA was isolated using the TRISOLV&#x2122; extraction as described by the manufacturer (Biotecx, Houston, TX). RNA was aliquoted and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C. RNA samples were analyzed for RNA integrity by gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized by the use of the TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), diluted, aliquoted, and stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of <italic>MDR1</italic>, <italic>MRP1</italic>, <italic>LRP</italic>, and <italic>BCRP</italic> by Taqman-chemistry on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using two endogenous reference genes, i.e., glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and porphobilinogen deaminase.</p>

        <title>Definition of endpoints</title>
        <p>The clinical endpoints have been defined previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In brief, complete response (CR) was defined as a normocellular BM with &lt;5% blasts, no Auer rods, and no evidence of extramedullary involvement. Because data on peripheral blood recovery within 60&#xA0;days were not always available, they were not considered as a criterium for CR. Patients who relapsed or died within 28&#xA0;days after CR were considered as not having achieved a CR. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the date of randomization until no CR on induction therapy, relapse after CR, or death in CR, whichever came first. Patients who did not reach CR were considered failure for EFS at 1&#xA0;day after randomization. Disease-free survival (DFS) was determined for all patients who achieved CR on induction therapy and was calculated from the date of CR until relapse or death, whichever came first. Overall survival (OS) was measured from randomization until death from any cause. Patients who were still alive at the date of last contact were then censored.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>The original phase 3 trial had been designed to detect with a power of 80% an increase in 2-year EFS from 9.5% in the control arm (without PSC-833) to 18% in the PSC-833 arm (two-sided significance level <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) and included 419 eligible patients.</p>
        <p>mRNA data were obtained from a subset of 154 patients with sufficient BM samples in our tissue bank available for analysis. Baseline parameters of interest were <italic>MDR1</italic>, <italic>MRP1</italic>, <italic>LRP</italic>, and <italic>BCRP</italic> mRNA expression. Clinical endpoints were CR rate, EFS, DFS, and OS.</p>
        <p>Baseline characteristics of patients with or without mRNA expression data available were compared using the Fisher exact test or the Pearson <italic>&#x3C7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test in case of discrete variables, whichever appropriate, or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in case of continuous variables. The association between patient baseline characteristics and mRNA expression levels was analyzed using the Pearson <italic>&#x3C7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test of the Spearman rank correlation test, whichever was appropriate. The prognostic value of mRNA levels with respect to CR rate was determined using logistic regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] whereas the impact of <italic>MDR1</italic>, <italic>MRP1</italic>, <italic>LRP</italic>, and <italic>BCRP</italic> on EFS, DFS, and OS was analyzed with Cox regression analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For this purpose, the natural logarithm of the mRNA expression levels of the four resistance genes were included in the analyses because of the very skewed distribution of the original mRNA levels. In addition, the outcome of patients with coexpression of <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>BCRP</italic> was evaluated to confirm the poor prognosis of AML with <italic>MDR1</italic>/<italic>BCRP</italic> coexpression reported by Benderra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in patients with a median age of 45&#xA0;years or older. These patients were defined as having mRNA levels of these two drug resistance genes equal to or higher than the median. Their outcome was compared to the other patients with at least one of the <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>BCRP</italic> mRNA expression levels below the median. Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were performed unadjusted, as well as adjusted for other prognostic factors, i.e., secondary AML, natural logarithm of WBC count, square root of percentage CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and cytogenetic risk (favorable/intermediate versus unfavorable versus unknown), as well as for treatment arm in the phase 3 trial, as about half of the patients had been randomized to receive PSC-833 in addition to their chemotherapy. Kaplan&#x2013;Meier curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] were generated to illustrate survival and were compared using the log-rank test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. All reported <italic>p</italic> values are two-sided and, in view of the exploratory nature of these analyses, were calculated without adjustment for multiple testing. <italic>p</italic> values&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>In the phase 3 trial, a total of 419 untreated patients with AML aged 60&#xA0;years and older were randomized to receive two induction cycles with or without PSC-833. As reported, no difference was found between both treatment arms as regards CR rate (54% in the PSC-833 arm versus 48% in the control arm, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.22), 5-year EFS (7 versus 8%, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.53) nor DFS (13 versus 17%, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.06) and OS (10% in both arms, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.52) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We previously reported the role of functional MDR1 expression with respect to clinical outcome in these patients.</p>
      <p>In 154/419 of the patients, sufficient BM cells were available in our tissue bank to investigate the mRNA expression level of the drug resistance genes <italic>MDR1</italic>, <italic>MRP1</italic>, <italic>LRP</italic>, and <italic>BCRP</italic>. This subgroup consisted of a representative group according to age, gender, CD34 expression, cytogenetics, and FAB classification (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In this test group, a higher WBC count at diagnosis was observed than in the other 265 patients, and relatively more patients had been randomized to the PSC-833 arm (57 versus 45%, <italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). There was no significant difference in the levels of <italic>MDR1</italic>, <italic>MRP1</italic>, <italic>LRP</italic>, nor <italic>BCRP</italic> mRNA expression between the two treatment arms (data not shown).

Recently, two studies in, respectively, 40 and 31 adult AML patients showed no effect of <italic>BCRP</italic> gene expression on CR rate, whereas OS was lower in patients with the highest <italic>BCRP</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Damiani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] showed that <italic>BCRP</italic> expression did not influence achievement of complete remission in AML patients with a median age of 53&#xA0;years and normal karyotype, however, <italic>BCRP</italic> expression was associated with higher relapse rate. In 59 children with de novo AML, a higher <italic>BCRP</italic> expression was observed in patients who did not reach CR, but this was not translated in poorer survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Benderra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] indicated that <italic>BCRP</italic> gene expression was an adverse prognostic factor for CR in a group of 149 relatively younger adult AML patients but only in patients treated with DNR and MXT and not with idarubicin. In our cohort of elderly AML patients who were all treated with DNR, whereas MXT was given as consolidation therapy after reaching CR, a significant correlation of <italic>BCRP</italic> mRNA expression with lower CR rate could not be shown.</p>
      <p>Our study confirms that <italic>BCRP</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic> are coexpressed in AML patients with higher age as has been suggested previously from studies in smaller groups of relatively younger AML patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Until now, only two studies have evaluated the clinical value of coexpression of <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>BCRP</italic> in a sufficient number, although relatively younger adult AML patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Benderra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed that CR rate was only 45% in the patients with coexpression of <italic>BCRP</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic> (+/+) in comparison with 66% in the <italic>MDR1</italic>/<italic>BCRP</italic>&#x2212;/+ and +/&#x2212;group and 90% in the <italic>MDR1/BCRP</italic>&#x2212;/&#x2212;group (<italic>p</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Moreover, a significantly lower DFS and OS were found in the <italic>MDR1</italic>/<italic>BCRP</italic>+/+group. Damiani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] found a trend towards a higher relapse rate in the small group of <italic>BCRP</italic>+/<italic>MDR1</italic>+patients, indicating that this represents a robust resistant AML phenotype, consistent with our findings in elderly AML. The recent finding that <italic>BCRP</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic> expression was mainly found in the most resistant group of AML, using gene expression profiling, underscores the role of these drug resistance genes in AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>However, this study shows, that the prominent prognostic role of CD34 expression in elderly AML should be emphasized, as higher CD34 expression was adversely associated with all clinical endpoints. <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>BCRP</italic> but not <italic>MRP1</italic> and <italic>LRP</italic> mRNA expression were found to be associated with high CD34 expression in these elderly AML patients, which may explain why <italic>MDR1</italic> was no longer significant for CR rate, EFS, and OS when adjusted for other prognostic variables including CD34. In the past, MDR1 expression has been linked to the CD34-positive hematopoietic stem cell compartment of the leukemia subtype. In two other studies in younger AML patients, no overexpression (on mRNA and protein level) of <italic>BCRP</italic> in the CD34-positive blast population of clinical AML samples was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, earlier studies in mice demonstrated high levels of <italic>BCRP</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic> expression in normal hematopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Previously, <italic>BCRP</italic> expression in subsets of stem cells has been reported, indicating that high <italic>BCRP</italic> expression may exist in CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD38<sup>&#x2212;</sup> cells or in CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD33<sup>&#x2212;</sup>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The differential expression of <italic>BCRP</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic> in specific subsets of hematopoietic stem cells is consistent with the side population phenotype as proposed by Goodell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] who claim that BCRP expression can be separated from those expressing the other ABC proteins. This would suggest that BCRP is expressed in even less differentiated hematopoietic stem cells than MDR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study in AML, these immature subsets could not be separately investigated, however, the unique <italic>BCRP/MDR1</italic>+/+subgroup of patients reflects an immature leukemic cell type that has a very resistant phenotype in vivo, illustrated by a low CR rate and poor outcome (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>This is the first study in which a correlation was found between secondary AML and a high expression of <italic>BCRP</italic> mRNA but not the other resistance proteins. In addition to our previous report that <italic>BCRP</italic> is frequently upregulated in patients with AML at relapse, we now demonstrate that expression of <italic>BCRP</italic> is representative of secondary AML, which is especially observed in elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Recently, Ross [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] suggested that MDR modifiers may be of benefit for patients with multiple dysplastic features. This may suggest that <italic>BCRP</italic> is upregulated in diseases in which exposure to xenobiotics during life plays an etiologic role.</p>
      <p>We conclude that coexpression of CD34-related coexpression of <italic>MDR1</italic> and <italic>BCRP</italic> reflects a clinically resistant subgroup of elderly AML. In this age group, only <italic>BCRP</italic> is correlated with secondary AML. As such, the development of new treatment strategies for elderly AML patients may focus on modulation of drug resistance targeting both <italic>BCRP</italic> and <italic>MDR1</italic>.</p>
