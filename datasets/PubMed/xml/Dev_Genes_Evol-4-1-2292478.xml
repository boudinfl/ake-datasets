      <abstract>
        <p>The <italic>Drosophila teashirt</italic> gene acts in concert with the homeotic selector (Hox) genes to specify trunk (thorax and abdomen) identity. There has been speculation that this trunk-specifying function might be very ancient, dating back to the common ancestor of insects and vertebrates. However, other evidence suggests that the role of <italic>teashirt</italic> in trunk identity is not well conserved even within the Insecta. To address this issue, we have analyzed the function of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic>, the lone <italic>teashirt</italic> family member in the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. Although <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> is important for aspects of both embryonic and imaginal development including some trunk features, we find no evidence that it acts as a trunk identity gene. We discuss this finding in the context of recent insights into the evolution and function of the <italic>Drosophila teashirt</italic> family genes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Homeotic genes are responsible for defining regional identity, and mutations in these genes often transform one body part into another. The best characterized homeotic genes are the Hox genes, which have been identified in representatives of most animal phyla (reviewed by Martindale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>) and have been extensively studied in several organisms. However, some non-Hox genes have also been classified as homeotic genes based on their mutant phenotypes. One such gene encodes the zinc finger transcription factor Teashirt (Fasano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1991</xref>). Loss-of-function (LOF) <italic>teashirt</italic> (<italic>tsh</italic>) mutations are reported to cause partial transformation of the larval prothorax to a labial identity due to ectopic expression of the Hox gene <italic>Sex combs reduced</italic> (Fasano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1991</xref>; Roder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1992</xref>). The trunk (thoracic and abdominal) segments of <italic>tsh</italic><sup>&#x2212;</sup> larvae are shorter than normal and the denticle belts (a trunk-specific feature) are severely disorganized. Moreover, patches of sclerotic cuticle, which have been interpreted as head structures, form between the remaining denticle belts (Fasano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1991</xref>). Conversely, ectopic expression of <italic>tsh</italic> results in the development of denticle belts in the head (de Zulueta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1994</xref>). On the basis of these phenotypes, <italic>tsh</italic> has been suggested to function as a specifier of trunk vs head identity (Roder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1992</xref>).</p>
      <p><italic>tsh</italic> is believed to act in parallel with the trunk Hox genes (<italic>Scr</italic>, <italic>Antennapedia</italic> (<italic>Antp</italic>), <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>), <italic>abdominal-A</italic> (<italic>abd-A</italic>), and <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>)) to determine segmental identity (de Zulueta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1994</xref>; Roder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1992</xref>). When all of these Hox genes are inactivated, trunk segments develop with what has been interpreted as a mixed head/trunk identity. That is, sclerotized tissue develops in the posterior compartment of each trunk segment, whereas denticle belts (a trunk-specific feature) still develop in the anterior compartment (Sato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1985</xref>; Struhl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1983</xref>). When <italic>tsh</italic> function is also eliminated, the trunk segments are more severely affected in that denticle belts disappear and additional head-like cuticle is observed (Roder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1992</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recent data suggests that <italic>tsh</italic> may play an even greater role in trunk development than was previously recognized. In the absence of <italic>tsh</italic> function, its paralog <italic>tiptop</italic> (<italic>tio</italic>) is ectopically expressed in the trunk region (Laugier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). When <italic>tio</italic> and <italic>tsh</italic> functions are both absent, the trunk denticles are even more severely affected than in mutants that lack only <italic>tsh</italic>, suggesting that <italic>tio</italic> can partially substitute for <italic>tsh</italic> and reduce the effects of <italic>tsh</italic> mutations.</p>
      <p>Robertson and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>) proposed the existence of a system of zinc-finger proteins that divides the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo into sections and limits the functional domains of Hox genes. They suggest that within this system <italic>tsh</italic> specifies the trunk region, while <italic>disconnected</italic> (<italic>disco</italic>) specifies the gnathal region. In the absence of <italic>tsh</italic>, <italic>disco</italic> (as well as its paralog <italic>disco-related</italic>) is ectopically expressed in the trunk, and there is some evidence that ectopic <italic>disco</italic> expression is responsible for at least some features of <italic>tsh</italic> mutants (e.g., loss of denticles and abnormal sensory neurons) that are thought to represent a switch to head/gnathal identity (Robertson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Manfroid et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>) speculated that the trunk-specifying function of <italic>tsh</italic> family members might be conserved in vertebrates, as <italic>tsh</italic> genes from mice are expressed in the trunk region and can also rescue the phenotype of <italic>Drosophila tsh</italic> mutants when ectopically expressed. However, such conjecture requires a rather large phylogenetic leap, as it is not clear that the role of <italic>tsh</italic> in trunk specification is conserved even in other insects. <italic>tsh</italic> family genes of the firebrat, <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic>, and the milkweed bug, <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>, are expressed predominantly in the gnathos and thorax, arguing against a function in trunk specification (Herke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>). Furthermore, when Herke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>) knocked down the function of the <italic>Oncopeltus tsh</italic> family gene by RNA interference (RNAi), they observed transformations of distal leg to antenna, but did not report any changes in trunk identity. Finally, our previous studies suggest that genetic specification of trunk identity in the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, differs significantly from that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Removal of trunk Hox genes alone is sufficient to produce dramatic transformation of trunk to head identity (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2002</xref>). Antennae develop on all gnathal and trunk segments of embryos homozygous for a deficiency that removes the <italic>Tribolium</italic> orthologs of <italic>Deformed</italic> (<italic>Dfd</italic>), <italic>Scr</italic>, <italic>Antp</italic>, <italic>Ubx</italic>, and <italic>abd-A</italic> (Stuart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1991</xref>). Thus, there is apparently no need to invoke the function of another gene for trunk identity. Peterson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>) predicted that either the <italic>Tribolium tsh</italic> gene has no function in trunk specification or that the expression of <italic>tsh</italic> is controlled by Hox genes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the trunk-specifying role of <italic>tsh</italic> observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> might not be conserved in other insects.</p>
      <p>To better understand the evolution of <italic>tsh</italic> family gene function, we cloned and characterized a <italic>tsh</italic> homolog from <italic>Tribolium</italic>. This gene, <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic>, is the sole member of this family in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> genome. It has a broad embryonic expression domain, encompassing not only the trunk region but much of the head as well. RNAi experiments revealed that <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> functions in several embryonic and imaginal tissues, but they did not suggest a conserved function in trunk specification. We discuss these results and reexamine the classification of <italic>tsh</italic> as a trunk-specifying gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

        <p>A genomic fragment of the <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> gene was amplified using degenerate primers based on the conserved amino acid motifs VWLGKG and CKVCDK (first round) and ILKCMW and CKVCDK (second round). Additional, overlapping fragments were identified by RACE, using the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; RACE Systems (GibcoBRL), by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening a <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> cDNA library as described previously (Nie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2001</xref>), or by inverse PCR (Ochman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1988</xref>). To confirm that these overlapping fragments represent a contiguous sequence, primers were designed near the ends of the putative contig, and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed using total embryonic RNA (0&#x2013;30&#xA0;h of development) as template. The resulting PCR product was cloned and sequenced (GenBank accession number AF356647).</p>

Multiple alignments were created with the AlignX module of Vector NTI 8 (InforMax). Minor manual adjustments were performed to maximize the alignments.

        <p>dsRNA of two different, non-overlapping fragments of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> was synthesized using the PCR template method described by Kennerdell and Carthew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2000</xref>).

The resulting product was purified and 1 &#x3BC;g used as template for RNA synthesis using the Megascript T7 High Yield Transcription kit (Ambion).</p>
        <p>For embryonic RNAi, 0&#x2013;2&#xA0;h eggs were collected from wild-type beetles (GA-1) and injected with dsRNA (2&#x2013;4&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/&#x3BC;l) as previously described by Brown et al.

        <p>We cloned a member of the <italic>tsh</italic> gene family from the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref> for details). Comparison of the cDNA sequence to the recently completed <italic>Tribolium</italic> genome sequence revealed three exons distributed over about 90&#xA0;kb (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Most of this distance can be attributed to an approximately 86-kb intron between the first and second exons.

        <p>Only three full-length Tsh family proteins have been described from insects: the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> paralogs Tsh and Tio, and the single member of the Tsh family in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, Ag-TioTsh (Fasano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1991</xref>; Laugier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). In addition, small fragments of <italic>tsh</italic> family genes have been amplified from several other insects (Herke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>). Two conclusions have been drawn from these limited data. First, the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes seem to be the result of a recent duplication in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage. Second, all of the Tsh family members from other insects appear to be more similar in sequence to Tio than to Tsh. In this paper, we present data that support and greatly strengthen these conclusions.</p>
        <p>We performed a tBLASTn search of several recently sequenced insect genomes for <italic>tsh</italic> family members (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> gene that we cloned is the only member of the <italic>tsh</italic> family present in the genome sequence of this insect. Likewise, the <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (honeybee) genome contains only a single member of this gene family. In contrast, all of the additional <italic>Drosophila</italic> species we searched (<italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic> and <italic>D. virilis</italic>) have orthologs of both <italic>tio</italic> and <italic>tsh</italic>. Consistent with the situation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Laugier et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>), <italic>tio</italic> and <italic>tsh</italic> are closely linked (less than 250&#xA0;kb apart) in all of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> species examined, suggesting that these genes likely arose from a relatively recent tandem duplication event.

        <p>As the <italic>Tribolium</italic> gene is related to both <italic>tio</italic> and <italic>tsh,</italic> we have named it <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic>, after the convention established by Laugier et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>) for the single <italic>Anopheles</italic> gene. We compared the predicted Tc-TioTsh protein to the other insect Tsh family members for which full-length predicted proteins are available. (Although, we were able to identify a <italic>tsh</italic> family gene in Apis, the 5&#x2032; portion of the transcription unit was apparently missing from the genome sequence.) Like <italic>tio</italic> and <italic>Ag-tiotsh</italic> (Laugier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>), <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> encodes four zinc fingers (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), three of which are clustered near the middle of the protein (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), and one that is located near the C terminus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Besides the zinc finger regions, several additional short regions of sequence identity (shaded in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and data not shown) are present in all of the full-length predicted proteins. The three dipteran proteins are highly similar at their N termini, while Tio, Ag-TioTsh, and Tc-TioTsh share a C-terminal motif (in addition to the fourth zinc finger) that is absent in Tsh. Regions shared between the beetle and dipteran proteins have been conserved over a long phylogenetic distance, suggesting that they likely have important functions.

        <p>To better understand the evolutionary history of the <italic>tsh</italic> gene family, we have performed phylogenetic analyses using conserved portions of the zinc-finger region (underlined in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) from the full-length insect Tsh family proteins that are currently available (<italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Tribolium</italic>, and <italic>Anopheles</italic>). Both maximum likelihood (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and neighbor-joining (data not shown) methods produce trees in which the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins cluster together, suggesting these genes were produced by duplication after the divergence of the mosquito and fly lineages. The branch lengths of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins are much longer than those of <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic>, suggesting rapid divergence of both genes after duplication.

        <p>The mouse and human genomes each have three <italic>tsh</italic> family members (Caubit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2000</xref>; Manfroid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>), which are much more similar to one another than they are to any of the insect proteins. Interestingly, vertebrate Tsh family proteins share an N-terminal motif (MPRRKQ) with the <italic>Tribolium</italic> protein (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), which is distinct from the N-terminal motif shared by the dipteran family members (Laugier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). The conservation of this sequence in an insect and vertebrates suggests it has an important function and that it was probably present in the common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these comparisons of <italic>tsh</italic> family members indicate that the ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes had a single <italic>tsh</italic> family gene. We were unable to identify any <italic>tsh</italic> family members in the genomes of two non-bilaterian metazoans: the placozoan <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Triad1/Triad1.home.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Triad1/Triad1.home.html</ext-link>) and the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (Putnam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>), suggesting this gene family may have arisen after the bilaterian/non-bilaterian split. Within the vertebrate lineage, duplication events (perhaps in association with whole genome duplications) produced at least three paralogs. A duplication in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage (after divergence from the mosquito lineage) resulted in the <italic>tsh</italic> and <italic>tio</italic> paralogs.</p>

        <p>We examined the embryonic expression pattern of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) by in situ hybridization, using the posterior compartment marker Engrailed (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994a</xref>; Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1989</xref>) to determine the stage of embryonic development (segments are added sequentially) and provide a reference for the register of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> expression. <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> expression develops in a dynamic, pair rule-like manner (Fig. S<xref ref-type="" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and S<xref ref-type="" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>), but eventually encompasses not only the trunk segments (thorax and abdomen), but also the gnathal segments and the labrum and intercalary segment in the procephalon (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> expression in the thorax and the first abdominal segment appears somewhat stronger than in other regions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). As appendages develop, <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> is expressed in the proximal portion of each leg (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d).

        <p>We used RNAi to ascertain the probable LOF phenotype of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic>. Pupae injected with <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> dsRNA produced very few eggs upon reaching adulthood, and none of these progeny showed an abnormal phenotype. To circumvent the apparent effect of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> on oogenesis, we injected <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> dsRNA either directly into eggs or into the abdomens of non-virgin adult females (egg production from these females quickly tapers off, further indicating an effect on oogenesis). Injection of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> dsRNA by either technique produced embryos with defects in the labial and thoracic segments (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, and data not shown). During normal <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryonic development, the two labial appendages fuse at the ventral midline and migrate anteriorly to a position between the maxillary appendages (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). In moderately affected <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> RNAi larvae (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), the labial appendages are smaller than normal, and in the most severely affected embryos (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c) these appendages fail to fuse. In all of these cases, the abnormal labial appendages fail to migrate to their normal position between the maxillary palps. These abnormalities produce secondary effects on the orientation of the other head appendages.

        <p>Short legs were the most common feature seen in <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> RNAi larvae, being present in all larvae with labial defects, as well as in some larvae with apparently normal labial appendages (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The reduction in leg length stems from effects on the proximal leg segments. The coxa and trochanter are reduced and apparently fused, and the femur is slightly shortened (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). This phenotype is similar to that observed in the adult legs of hypomorphic <italic>Drosophila tsh</italic> mutants (Erkner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>) and thus may indicate a conserved role for <italic>tsh</italic> family genes in proximal limb development.</p>

Most noticeably, these individuals have abnormalities of the T2 notum that prevent the elytra from closing properly (data not shown). We also observed mild defects in the proximal legs. In addition, adults resulting from <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> larval RNAi show abnormalities in many of the ventral sclerites (sternites) (see El-Kifl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1953</xref> for a description of wild-type structures). In the ventral prothorax (T1) of RNAi-treated individuals, the epimera, which are normally located posterior to the T1 coxae, are missing and the basisternum is reduced in size resulting in the exposure of membranous areas (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b,d). In addition, the shape of the sternellum (the process extending between the T1 legs) is abnormal. Ventral T2 is not noticeably affected, but the T3 sternite is missing its anterior process (meso-spinasternum) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). The anterior abdominal segments are also affected by <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> larval RNAi.

        <title>Evolution of <italic>tsh</italic> family genes</title>
        <p>Searches of several non-drosophilid insect genome sequences identified only a single <italic>tsh</italic> family member in each genome. These results corroborate previous suggestions (based on more limited data) that most insects have only a single <italic>tsh</italic>-related gene and that this is the ancestral state (Herke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Laugier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). A key implication of this model is that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes <italic>tio</italic> and <italic>tsh</italic> are the result of a recent duplication event that occurred sometime after the divergence of mosquitoes and flies. Since that duplication, <italic>tsh</italic> has apparently diverged from the ancestral sequence faster than has <italic>tio</italic> (although both have diverged more than the <italic>Tribolium</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> homologs). More rapid divergence by one member of a recently duplicated gene pair is not unprecedented. For example, the <italic>Hox3</italic> paralogs <italic>zerkn&#xFC;llt</italic> (<italic>zen</italic>) and <italic>bicoid</italic> (<italic>bcd</italic>) are believed to have arisen by duplication late in the dipteran lineage (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; Stauber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2002</xref>), but the sequence of Zen is more similar to that of the Hox 3 proteins of other insects than it is to Bcd.</p>
        <p>Much of the sequence conservation between Tsh family members is found in the zinc finger regions. However, a few additional conserved motifs are present, particularly at the protein termini. The C-terminal region is well conserved between Tc-TioTsh, Ag-TioTsh, and Tio, but this conserved region is not found in Tsh. The conservation of the N-terminal region is particularly interesting. The Tsh family members for which N-terminal sequence is available fall into two distinct classes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Ag-TioTsh and both <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins share an extended region of identity that is completely different than the short motif (MPRRKQ) shared by the <italic>Tribolium</italic> and vertebrate proteins. This pattern of conservation suggests that an ancestral Tsh family member had the MPRRKQ motif, which was replaced with a different motif sometime before the separation of <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> within the dipteran lineage. It is not clear what the function of these disparate motifs might be, as the vertebrate Tsh proteins function very similarly to Dm-Tsh when expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Manfroid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). Perhaps these motifs are important in a particular tissue or at a different stage in development than those assayed. As additional insect Tsh family protein sequences become available, it will be possible to more accurately determine the point at which these N-terminal sequences began to diverge.</p>

        <p>Although the sequences of other insect <italic>tsh</italic> family members are most similar to <italic>tio</italic>, their expression patterns (where known) seem to be more similar to <italic>tsh</italic>. The embryonic expression patterns of <italic>tsh</italic> and <italic>tio</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are strikingly different (Laugier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). <italic>tsh</italic> is expressed throughout the ectoderm of trunk segments, while <italic>tio</italic> is expressed in only a few cells of the trunk ectoderm (as well as in the Malpighian tubules and parts of the CNS and gut). In <italic>tsh</italic> mutants, however, <italic>tio</italic> is more broadly expressed in the trunk, indicating that <italic>tsh</italic> represses <italic>tio</italic> expression in this region. Likewise, <italic>tsh</italic> is ectopically expressed in the stomodeal region when <italic>tio</italic> expression is knocked down by RNAi.</p>
        <p>The <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> expression pattern includes similiarities to both the <italic>tsh</italic> and <italic>tio</italic> expression patterns. The ectodermal expression in the segmented region of the germband is reminiscent of, although more extensive than, that of <italic>tsh</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> is expressed in the Malpighian tubule primordia, similar to <italic>tio</italic>. The expression of <italic>tio</italic> near the stomodeum might also correspond to the expression of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> in the labrum and intercalary segment, although it is difficult to compare expression patterns in the cephalic regions of these insects due to the derived structure of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval head.</p>
        <p>It is interesting that the <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> expression pattern approximates the sum of the <italic>tsh</italic> and <italic>tio</italic> patterns. This may indicate that the expression pattern of the ancestral gene that gave rise to <italic>tsh</italic> and <italic>tio</italic> had an expression pattern similar to <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> and that parts of its expression pattern (and perhaps its function) have been split between its daughters. Such division of labor resulting from complementary loss of particular expression domains or functions is termed subfunctionalization and has been suggested to play a key role in the maintenance of duplicated genes (Force et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1999</xref>).</p>
        <p>Among other insects, expression patterns of <italic>tsh</italic> family members have been reported only for the firebrat, <italic>Thermobia domestica</italic>, and the milkweed bug, <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> (Herke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>). In both cases, these genes are expressed in the gnathal, thoracic, and first abdominal segments, with very weak (if any) expression in the remainder of the abdomen. Both insects also show expression in the posterior tip of the embryo (see below). <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> has additional expression in the procephalon. The leg expression pattern in firebrats has not been described, but Herke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>) reported that milkweed bugs show expression throughout the legs, which fades from the distal tips later in development.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, all of the insect <italic>tsh</italic> family genes whose expression has been described are expressed in the post-abdominal region. However, these domains have been interpreted differently. In firebrats, expression in this region is reported to represent the anlagen of the cerci and the median caudal filament (appendages of the 11th abdominal segment) (Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>). The posterior expression of <italic>tsh</italic> has been interpreted as the future anal opening (Fasano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1991</xref>), and that of <italic>Oncopeltus tiptop</italic> is described only as the caudal region (Herke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>). Our results show that <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> is expressed in the Malpighian tubule primordia. Likewise, <italic>tio</italic> is expressed in the developing Malpighian tubules (Laugier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). Thus, Malpighian tubule expression may have been part of the ancestral expression pattern of this gene family. It is possible that the posterior expression domains in other insects will, upon closer examination, be found to represent the developing Malpighian tubules as well.</p>

        <title>Evolution of <italic>tsh</italic> family function</title>
        <p><italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> is required for the proper development of the proximal portion of developing larval legs. <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae lack external appendages, but <italic>tsh</italic> is expressed in the proximal regions of leg imaginal discs and hypomorphic <italic>tsh</italic> alleles cause proximal leg defects (Erkner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>). These results suggest that proximal leg expression and function were probably a feature of a <italic>tsh</italic>-like gene in the ancestor of beetles and flies. In contrast, Herke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>) reported that knockdown of <italic>Oncopeltus tiptop</italic> caused transformations of the distal legs to antennae. Based on this observation, they concluded that <italic>Oncopeltus tiptop</italic> acts as a distal leg selector gene, and suggested that <italic>tio</italic> or <italic>tsh</italic> might play a similar role in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>tsh</italic> expression is known to be restricted to the portion of the imaginal disc that will form the body wall and proximal leg segments (Gonzalez-Crespo and Morata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> is expressed in the proximal region of embryonic legs and leg imaginal discs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d and data not shown). We have also examined the expression of <italic>tio</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg imaginal discs and found that expression is restricted to the body wall and proximal portion of the developing leg. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the &#x201C;tiptop-like&#x201D; distal leg-specifying function suggested by Herke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>) is performed by Tio, either alone or in combination with Tsh.</p>
        <p>We cannot rule out additional, internal functions for Tc-TioTsh. In particular, the expression of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> in the Malpighian tubules is intriguing, as <italic>Drosophila tio</italic> (and possibly other homologs) show similar expression.</p>
        <p>The striking effects of larval <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> RNAi would not have been predicted based on <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments, as relatively few adult effects of LOF <italic>tsh</italic> mutations have been reported. Other than the proximal leg defects that have been discussed above, the only other adult phenotypes reported are defects in wing posture (Soanes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>) and in structures that develop from the eye-antennal disc, namely, the eyes (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>) and the maxillary palps (Bhojwani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>). This dearth of adult phenotypes could be a consequence of the pre-adult lethality of many <italic>tsh</italic> allele combinations. However, it might also be due to functional redundancy with <italic>tio</italic>. We examined <italic>tio</italic> expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs and found that it is indeed expressed in a pattern very similar to that of <italic>tsh</italic> (data not shown). Thus, loss of both <italic>tio</italic> and <italic>tsh</italic> during <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal development might produce a more severe phenotype.</p>
        <p>The principal question prompting our studies of the <italic>Tribolium Tc-tiotsh</italic> gene was whether the trunk-specifying function reported for <italic>tsh</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was conserved in other insects. However, insights from our work and other recent reports compel us to first reexamine whether <italic>tsh</italic> itself is really a trunk-specifying gene. The key observations, which originally led to this conclusion, were the presence of head-like sclerites in embryos lacking <italic>tsh</italic>, and the positive correlation between expression of <italic>tsh</italic> and the presence of denticle belts (a trunk-specific feature) (de Zulueta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1994</xref>; Fasano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1991</xref>; Roder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1992</xref>). The later discovery that <italic>tsh</italic> and <italic>disco</italic> form mutually exclusive domains in the trunk and head, respectively, seemed to support this view (Robertson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). Below we synthesize recent studies that may lead to new interpretations of these observations.</p>
        <p>A number of mutant phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including those of <italic>tsh</italic> and some Hox genes, feature small patches of sclerotic tissue. The previous interpretation of such patches as ectopic head tissue has been called into question. Mace et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>) showed that the sclerites that form in a segment lacking Hox gene expression are correlated with breaches in epidermal integrity and the resulting activation of a wound response pathway. If in fact, the sclerotized cuticle seen in <italic>tsh</italic> mutants is scar tissue rather than head cuticle, the interpretation of <italic>tsh</italic> as a trunk-specifying gene would be less convincing, but still possible.</p>
        <p>The case for <italic>tsh</italic> acting as a trunk specifier was apparently strengthened when Robertson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>) proposed the attractive hypothesis that a system of zinc finger proteins acted in conjunction with the Hox genes to specify body regions. Within this system, <italic>disco</italic> specified gnathal segments and <italic>tsh</italic> specified trunk segments. However, the same laboratory recently reported that the conserved role of <italic>disco</italic> is to specify the medial portion of appendages, and suggested that the boundary between <italic>disco</italic> and <italic>tsh</italic> expression is actually an artifact of maggot morphology (Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2007</xref>). That is, the reduced <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval head might lack proximal, <italic>tsh</italic>-expressing tissue (body wall) while retaining medial appendage tissue, whereas the trunk retains <italic>tsh</italic>-expressing tissue but has lost most appendage tissue. Taking this scenario a step further, ectopic expression of <italic>tsh</italic> might &#x201C;restore&#x201D; the body wall tissue of the head, creating larger, more complete segments. As the genes controlling segment formation also control denticle belt patterning, these enlarged head segments would have denticle belts as well. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that the additional denticle belts produced by ectopic <italic>tsh</italic> expression are interspersed with head-specific structures (de Zulueta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1994</xref>). When considered in this light, perhaps <italic>tsh</italic> is no more a trunk identity gene than are other genes involved in segment formation and denticle patterning such as <italic>wingless</italic>, <italic>rhomboid</italic>, or <italic>shavenbaby</italic>. On the other hand<italic>, tsh</italic> does seem to provide the spatial information that limits full segment formation to the trunk, and thus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> could be considered a trunk-specifying gene.</p>
        <p>In contrast, <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> does not appear to act in any way as a trunk identity gene. This is not to say that <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> has no role in the development of trunk segments, but rather that we find no evidence that it specifies trunk vs head fates. In embryos depleted of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> the ventral portions of the labial and thoracic segments are reduced, but not visibly transformed. Interestingly, some of the labial abnormalities observed in <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> RNAi larvae are reminiscent of those produced by loss of function alleles of <italic>prothoraxless</italic> (<italic>Tc-Antp</italic>) (Shippy, unpublished data). Knockdown of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> during imaginal development produces adults with patterning defects in the thoracic and abdominal sclerites, including possible transformations of anterior abdominal sclerites to a more posterior identity. These phenotypes, together with the reduction in <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> expression seen in Df(HOMC) embryos, suggest that <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> is regulated to some extent by Hox genes and may carry out a subset of the functions of these genes in both the head and the trunk.</p>
        <p>Our studies of <italic>Tc-tiotsh</italic> indicate that trunk specification is not a universal function of <italic>tsh</italic> family members. It is possible that this function has been lost in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. However, expression pattern data from other insects and functional analysis in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> argues against this conclusion. A more likely scenario is that <italic>tsh</italic> family members acquired a role in defining trunk at some point after the divergence of the coleopteran and dipteran lineages. Analysis of <italic>tsh</italic> function in additional holometabolous insects should help pinpoint when this event occurred.</p>
