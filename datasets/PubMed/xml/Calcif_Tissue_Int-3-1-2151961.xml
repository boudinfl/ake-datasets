          <title>Purpose</title>
          <p>To investigate the impact of the Ala1330Val (rs3736228, exon 18) and Val667Met (rs4988321, exon 9) polymorphisms of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene on peak bone mass in young men.</p>

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>The Odense Androgen Study (OAS) is a population-based study comprising 783 Caucasian men aged 20-30 years. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence polarization. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>The CC, CT, and TT genotypes in Ala1330Val were found in 75.6%, 21.8%, and 2.6% of the participants, respectively. Similarly, the GG, GA, and AA genotypes of Val667Met were found in 89.7%, 9.8%, and 0.5%, respectively. For the Ala1330Val polymorphism, no significant differences between the genotypes were found regarding BMD in the overall study population. However, when analysis was restricted to non-sedentary men (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;589), a significant association between the number of T-alleles and BMD in the spine and whole body were found. Each copy of the T-allele changed the Z-score of the spine by (median and 95% confidence interval) &#x2212;0.21 [95% CI: &#x2212;0.40; &#x2212;0.03] (<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;&lt;&#xA0;0.02). Analysis suggested an association between the AA genotype in the Val667Met polymorphism and increased body height and decreased BMD of the femoral neck; however, no significant gene-dose effect of the A-allele could be demonstrated in the whole population. When the analysis was restricted to non-sedentary subjects, however, each number of A-alleles was associated with a change in Z-score of &#x2212;0.26 [95% CI: &#x2212;0.51; &#x2212;0.01] (<italic>p</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.04). No further significant results emerged with haplotype analysis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Family and twin studies have demonstrated that genetic factors account for 50&#x2013;80% of the inter-individual variation in bone mineral density (BMD) in both women and men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Polymorphisms in a number of genes affect the bone phenotype regarding BMD, bone size, or fracture risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Only a small part of the overall variation in BMD, however, has been explained by the polymorphisms identified so far.</p>
    <p>The transmembrane proteins low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and LRP6 are essential in Wnt signaling. They are expressed in many tissues including osteoblasts and have been implicated in the adaptive response of bone to mechanical load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Located on chromosome 11q12&#x2013;14, activating mutations in the LRP5 gene are responsible for rare conditions with a &#x201C;high bone mass phenotype&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as well as autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and transgenic mice carrying the LRP5 G171V mutation have increased bone mass and bone biomechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Conversely, inactivating mutations are responsible for the osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and this syndrome is recapitulated by LRP5 inactivation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
    <p>In addition to these mutations, a number of polymorphisms have been described in the LRP5 gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP</ext-link>). One of these, the Ala1330Val (rs3736228, exon 18) polymorphism, has been associated with attenuated bone gain in prepubertal boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], decreased BMD in Japanese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], American [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Australian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and Dutch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] women as well as in elderly Dutch men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It has also been associated with an increased risk of fragility fractures in postmenopausal Australian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and in elderly Dutch men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. No association, however, was found between this polymorphism and bone loss in elderly men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Similarly, the Val667Met (rs4988321, exon 9) polymorphism was associated with attenuated bone gain in prepubertal boys but not in girls participating in a 1-year longitudinal Swiss study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the same study, this polymorphism was also associated with decreased lumbar spine bone mineral content and projected bone area and there was a trend toward lower BMD in the spine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These associations were mainly driven by men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and in haplotype analysis including Ala1330Val, most of the effect was conferred by the Val667Met polymorphism. Moreover, in a case-control study by Ferrari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] on idiopathic osteoporosis in males, both LRP5 polymorphisms significantly increased the odds ratio for osteoporosis. Additionally, Val667Met was associated with low stature in adults of both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, current evidence suggests that polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene may be involved in the control of peak bone mass and may increase the risk of osteoporosis in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
    <p>In the present study, we investigated the association between the Ala1330Val and Val667Met polymorphisms and peak bone mass in men in a population-based study.</p>

      <title>Subjects and Methods</title>
      <p>The Odense Androgen Study (OAS) is a population-based, prospective, observational study on the interrelationship between endocrine status, body composition, muscle function, and bone metabolism in young men. Details on the design and inclusion of participants are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In brief, 3,000 men aged 20&#x2013;30 years were randomly selected from the civil registration database in Fuenen County, Denmark, and invited by mail to participate in the study. These subjects also received a questionnaire regarding smoking, medication, chronic diseases, drug abuse, etc. A total of 2,042 questionnaires were returned, and from these 859 men expressed interest in participation in the clinical part of the study. Nineteen withdrew before an appointment for inclusion was made. Ten men did not meet with the inclusion criteria (Caucasian and age between 20&#x2013;29 years), and another 3 men gave their notice after the inclusion had stopped. Aside from these latecomers none of the responders were excluded. Of the remaining 827 eligible subjects, 43 did not attend for their appointment and did not wish to reschedule, but informed consent was obtained from 784 men, with dropout from 1 subject. Thus 783 Caucasian men gave written informed consent and were included in the OAS. These participants had similar age, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle, socio-economic status, and educational level as the background population, as evaluated by questionnaires and demographic data (manuscript in preparation). The protocol stipulated that subjects with massive substance or alcohol abuse, malignant disease or severe chronic disease be excluded; however, none of the responders fulfilled any of these criteria. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Fuenen and Vejle Counties (file number 20010198), conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration, and declared in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00150163, registered September 6, 2005.</p>

      <p>We found a significant association between the Ala1330Val and the Val667Met polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene and BMD in young men, especially when physical activity was taken into account as confounder. This finding supports a number of recent papers reporting significant associations between polymorphisms in this gene and BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some of these studies involved or were restricted to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, Ferrari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] suggested that the polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene are associated with bone gain in prepubertal boys. Only one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] failed to demonstrate an association between variations in the LRP5 gene and BMD, but most likely this is due to their restricted sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;219).</p>
      <p>Major disruption of the LRP5 gene (homozygous nonsense or frame-shift mutations) resulting in loss-of-function has been demonstrated to be responsible for the osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Conversely, a number of dominantly inherited gain-of-function mutations result in high bone mass phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Minor changes in this gene, i.e., frequently occurring polymorphisms, may also be of importance in the regulation of bone mass as suggested by the association studies mentioned above. Further support comes from mapping a quantitative trait locus for BMD to chromosome 11q12&#x2013;13 in some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] but not all studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In a case-control study comprising 78 men with idiopathic osteoporosis and 86 controls, Ferrari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that Ala1330Val and Val667Met conferred an odds ratio for osteoporosis of 2.98 (95% CI: 1.03&#x2013;8.81) and 3.27 (95% CI: 1.43&#x2013;7.44), respectively. Also, a single prospective study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] comprising 1,301 elderly Australian women demonstrated that the c.3357A&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;G (rs556442) polymorphism was associated with decreased BMD and increased incidence of fractures. This polymorphism located in exon 15 is synonymous but was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with Ala1330Val [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, Mizuguchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found a linkage equilibrium block comprising exons 7 to 18. In our study, no significant effect of Ala1330Val or Val667Met on BMD was found apart from the ANOVA analysis which suggested that the AA genotype at Val667Met was associated with low BMD of the hip and increased body height. The number of participants with this genotype, however, was low (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;4) and we found no significant gene-dose effect to back this finding. In non-sedentary subjects, however, we found a significant association between Ala1330Val genotype and the Val667Met and Z-score BMD in the spine both in unadjusted analysis and when adjusted for BMI, smoking, continuous medication, and serum levels of 25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>. Further, we observed an association between Ala1330Val and whole-body BMD in the unadjusted analysis. This interaction between lifestyle (sedentary/non-sedentary), LRP5 genotype, and BMD has not previously been reported. Such an association is fully in line with the proposed role of LRP5 as a player in adapting bone to weight-bearing. LRP5 acts as a co-receptor for Wnt proteins and is expressed in the osteoblast and a number of other cell types. The Ala1330Val (exon 18) polymorphism results in a substitution of alanine with the chemically similar valine. No functional studies have been performed on this polymorphism; however, the polymorphism is located within the second LDL-repeat of LRP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and this region is involved in the ligand binding of the LDL-receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Also, preliminary results have shown that drugs that inhibit Dkk binding to LRP5 increase bone formation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and LRP5 seems to be involved in the adaptive response of bone to mechanical load and may be partly responsible for the &#x201C;mechanostat&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is presently unclear why association between the Ala1330Val and Val667Met genotypes and BMD was found only in the spine and not in the hip in the non-sedentary group. Differences between the skeletal sites regarding loading pattern (compression vs. bending) and bone architecture (trabecular vs. cortical) may be important.</p>
      <p>In our study, the numbers of T-alleles and A-alleles of the Ala1330Val and Val667Met polymorphisms, respectively, were associated with a decrease in BMD of the lumbar spine of 0.2 SD in the non-sedentary participants (i.e., approximately 2.5%). Previous studies have assessed this impact to be from 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] in women and men and women, respectively. While a number of genes have been associated with bone mass in women (e.g., PTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], alpha-1 chain of type 1 collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], vitamin D receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], transforming growth factor beta-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], interleukin-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and osteoprotegerin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), only a few genes have been shown to be associated with peak bone mass in men. We have previously reported that the MTHFR gene is associated with peak bone mass in the same series of men as reported here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Each of these polymorphisms including the LRP5 gene only accounts for a fraction of the variability in BMD; however, the 2.5% impact suggested by our study is not trivial.</p>
      <p>We found no association between either projected bone area at the spine or hip, or body weight and any of the polymorphisms; however, our data demonstrated a significant impact of the AA genotype of the Val667Met polymorphism and body height as previously reported by Ferrari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and Koay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In our study, the number of subjects with the AA genotype was, however, very low (<italic>n</italic>&#xA0;=&#xA0;4). Thus, this finding clearly needs confirmation in other study designs.</p>
      <p>The allele frequencies found in our study corresponded closely to those reported in Dutch, Australian, Japanese, and Korean populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our study has some limitations. We only tested two polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene. We cannot, therefore, rule out the possibility that the associations found in our study could be due to other polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene or even in neighboring genes in linkage with the polymorphisms tested. Indeed, Bollerslev et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] found that several of the polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene were in linkage disequilibrium with each other in Australian women. In our study, haplotype analyses were negative. This might be due to the limited number of participants. Testing large arrays of polymorphisms or haplotypes in relation to many outcome variables (i.e., bone mass at several skeletal sites), however, carry an increased risk of detecting spurious associations. Also, our study had a limited size. Given the observed genotype frequency and BMD values, our study had the power to detect differences in BMDof the spine between CC and CT&#xA0;+&#xA0;TT of 0.037 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (alpha&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.05 and beta&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.80). Similarly, our study had the power to detect differences of 0.070 g/cm<sup>2</sup> between GG and GA&#xA0;+&#xA0;AA in the overall analysis.</p>
      <p>Our study also has several strengths. First, it was population-based. In contrast to most similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that recruited participants by advertisements, we recruited our participants by direct mailing on the basis of the National Personal Registry that includes all Danish citizens. This enabled us to account meticulously for the recruitment of our participants. Thus, our sample was not skewed with respect to key socio-economic parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Second, our population had a relatively homogeneous genetic background both due to a small influx to our population and since participants with a first- or second-generation immigrant background were excluded on the basis on data from our national registry. Third, we selected young men aged 20&#x2013;30 years since these were expected to have reached their peak bone mass. This was confirmed by our data demonstrating an infinitesimal decrease in BMD by age. Moreover, very few were afflicted with chronic diseases or had long-term exposure of environmental factors that may affect bone mass.</p>
      <p>We conclude that the Ala1330Val (exon 18) and Val667Met (exon 9) polymorphisms of the LRP5 gene are significantly associated with lumbar spine peak bone mass in physically active men, potentially accounting for 2.5% of BMD in the spine. This gene-environment interaction provides support for LRP5 as a mediator of load-induced bone formation and suggests that this gene is involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in men.</p>
