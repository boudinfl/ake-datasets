        <p>The <italic>HLA-A</italic> locus represents a single copy gene that displays abundant allelic polymorphism in the human population, whereas, in contrast, a nonhuman primate species such as the rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) possesses multiple <italic>HLA-A</italic>-like (<italic>Mamu-A</italic>) genes, which parade varying degrees of polymorphism. The number and combination of transcribed <italic>Mamu-A</italic> genes present per chromosome display diversity in a population of Indian animals. At present, it is not clearly understood whether these different <italic>A</italic> region configurations are evolutionarily stable entities. To shed light on this issue, rhesus macaques from a Chinese population and a panel of cynomolgus monkeys <italic>(Macaca fascicularis</italic>) were screened for various <italic>A</italic> region-linked variations. Comparisons demonstrated that most <italic>A</italic> region configurations are old entities predating macaque speciation, whereas most allelic variation (&gt;95%) is of more recent origin. The latter situation contrasts the observations of the major histocompatibility complex class II genes in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, which share a high number of identical alleles (&gt;30%) as defined by exon 2 sequencing.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) represents a multigene family that plays a crucial role in the generation of adaptive immune responses in vertebrate species. A key feature of the system is that some of its genes display abundant polymorphism at the population level. In addition, the number of <italic>Mhc</italic> class I or II genes may differ significantly between species, as well as between individuals of a species (Kelley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>). MHC polymorphisms may have a profound impact on several features such as disease susceptibility, organ transplantation, and reproductive success (Lagaaij et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1989</xref>; Goulder and Watkins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>; Bontrop and Watkins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>; Ziegler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). The MHC systems of various primate species, including humans, have been studied extensively (Watkins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1995</xref>; Antunes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1998</xref>; Bontrop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999</xref>; Adams and Parham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>; de Groot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>; Lafont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2004</xref>; Middleton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>; Marsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2005</xref>; Penedo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>; Abbott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Huchard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). For example, the MHC of the rhesus macaque (<italic>MhcMamu</italic>), an Old World primate species, has been shown to share many similarities with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system in humans. The evolutionary orthologs of the <italic>HLA-DP</italic>, -<italic>DQ</italic>, and -<italic>DR</italic> genes are also present in rhesus monkeys, and as in humans, these loci are polymorphic (Bontrop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999</xref>). The number of <italic>Mamu-DRB</italic> region configurations appears to be expanded in comparison with humans, and some of these regions seem to harbor an extended number of genes (Doxiadis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). Subsequent cDNA studies have illustrated, however, that in humans and rhesus macaques, comparable numbers of <italic>DRB</italic> genes are transcribed (de Groot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Apart from <italic>Mamu-E</italic> (Knapp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1998</xref>), <italic>-F</italic> (Otting and Bontrop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1993</xref>), <italic>-G</italic> (Boyson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1996a</xref>; Castro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>), and <italic>-AG</italic> (Boyson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>), rhesus macaques also possess a <italic>B</italic>-like sequence, designated <italic>Mamu-I</italic>, which appears to be present in each haplotype (Urvater et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2000</xref>). As observed in humans, these nonclassical genes display low levels of polymorphism. An ortholog of the <italic>HLA-C</italic> gene appears to be absent in the rhesus macaque, whereas evolutionary equivalents of the classical <italic>HLA-A</italic> and <italic>-B</italic> genes have been described (Boyson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1996b</xref>). The <italic>Mamu-A</italic> and <italic>-B</italic> genes have been subjected to several rounds of duplication as was shown by genomic sequencing (Daza-Vamenta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>; Kulski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>). Analysis of a panel of rhesus macaques, mainly originating from the Indian subcontinent, illustrated that the number and combination of <italic>Mamu-A</italic> and -<italic>B</italic> genes that are expressed per haplotype may differ at the population level (Otting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>). In the same study, marked differences in expression levels were shown. At this stage it is not known whether rhesus macaques originating from other geographic areas have unique <italic>Mhc</italic> class I alleles and/or region configurations. Comparative studies have illustrated that many <italic>Mhc</italic> loci and lineages predate speciation events. The sharing of <italic>Mhc</italic> alleles between two primate species seems to be a rare event, and only a few cases have been documented (Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>; Evans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>). An exception is provided by rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, which seem to share a high number of <italic>Mhc</italic> class II alleles as was defined by exon 2 sequencing (Blancher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Doxiadis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). Whether this sharing is because of introgression or purifying selection remains to be elucidated. Thus far, about 50 <italic>Mafa-A</italic> sequences have been published for the cynomolgus macaque (Uda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>; Krebs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). The absence of pedigreed material did not allow us to define <italic>Mafa-A</italic> loci or region configurations. For that reason, a panel of pedigreed cynomolgus macaques was incorporated in the present study. Comparison with rhesus macaque <italic>Mhc</italic> class I sequences obtained from different populations enabled us to draw conclusions on the evolutionary stability of <italic>A</italic> region variations.</p>

        <p>The Biomedical Primate Research Centre houses a self-sustaining colony of approximately 1,000 rhesus macaques, mainly of Indian origin, that have been pedigreed based on the segregation of serologically defined MHC allotypes (Bontrop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999</xref>; Penedo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>; Doxiadis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). Furthermore, a large collection of DNA samples as well as B-cell lines is available. In this study, B-cells derived from rhesus macaques of Chinese origin and from cynomolgus monkeys were used to isolate RNA. Most cynomolgus monkey samples originate from a pedigreed group housed at the campus of the University of Utrecht.</p>

        <title>cDNA cloning and sequencing</title>
        <p>RNA was isolated from B cells (Rneasy kit, Qiagen) and subjected to One-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as recommended by the supplier (Qiagen). The primers (5&#x2032;MAS) AATTCATGGCGCCCCGAACCCTCCTCCTGG, and (3&#x2032;MAS) CTAGACCACACAAGGCGGCTGTCTCAC were used, which are specific for class I <italic>A</italic> transcripts in macaques. The final elongation step was extended to 30&#xA0;min to generate a 3&#x2032;dA overhang. The RT-PCR products were cloned using the InsT/Aclone kit (Fermentas). After transformation, 16 to 32 colonies were picked for plasmid isolations. The separate <italic>Mamu-A</italic> loci show differences in expression levels, as indicated by the numbers of clones, picked from each animal. The alleles with high expression levels (majors) may be associated with serotypes and thus involved in classical antigen presentation, whereas those with low expression levels (minors) are considered nonclassicals and may exhibit more specialized types of functions (Otting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>Sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit, and samples were run on an automated capillary sequencing system (ABI Genetic Analyzer 3100) as has been described previously (Otting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>).</p>

        <title>Locus-specific PCR reactions</title>
        <p>To test the presence of <italic>Mamu</italic>- and <italic>Mafa-A4*14</italic> alleles, 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;l of the RT-PCR samples was taken for a single-specific-primer PCR (SSP-PCR) reaction in advance of the cloning step. The relevant primers, (5&#x2032;A*14) GGGACCCGACGGGCGCCTCCAA and (3&#x2032;A*14) GGCCCTCCAGGTAGACTCTGTC have annealing sites in exon 3. Amplifications were carried out starting with 2&#xA0;min at 94&#xB0;C, followed by 25 cycles at 94&#xB0;C, 65&#xB0;C, and 72&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min each. The PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing, and the reactions were performed as described above.</p>

        <title>Phylogenetic analysis and nomenclature</title>
        <p>The sequences were analyzed with the Sequence Navigator Software version 1.0.1 (Applied Biosystems), and alleles are based on at least three clones with identical full-length sequences. To define loci and lineages, alignments of the sequences were made using the MacVector&#x2122; version 8.1.1 (Oxford Molecular Group), followed by manual adjustments. Phylogenetic analyses on the full-length (1,065&#xA0;bp) sequences were also performed with the MacVector software. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed with the Kimura 2 parameter method. Bootstrap analyses were performed based on 1,000 replications.</p>
        <p>In total, 130 unreported <italic>Mamu-A</italic> and <italic>Mafa-A</italic> sequences were submitted to the European Bioinformatics Institute and European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EBI-EMBL) database. Relevant information such as accession number and a reference cell-line are provided (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, all novel <italic>Mamu-A</italic> and <italic>Mafa-A</italic> sequences are named in accordance with a generally accepted nomenclature proposal (Klein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1990</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>; Ellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). For example, <italic>Mamu-A1*0101</italic> defines a <italic>Mhc</italic> allele in the rhesus macaque, which is encoded by one of the class I loci: namely, <italic>A1</italic>. The first two digits after the asterisk define the lineage, whereas the third and fourth digits define the allele number. These allele numbers are arbitrary, as they reflect the order in which the alleles were discovered. A fifth and sixth digit are used to mark a synonymous basepair difference between two sequences.

        <title>Polymorphism and diversity of the <italic>Mamu-A</italic> region: comparison of Chinese and Indian rhesus macaques</title>
        <p>In a previous communication, five different <italic>Mamu-A</italic> region configurations were defined in a population of Indian rhesus macaques (Otting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>). These configurations display diversity with regard to the number and combination of distinct <italic>Mamu-A</italic> genes present per chromosome. The loci have been designated <italic>Mamu-A1</italic>, <italic>-A2</italic>, <italic>-A3</italic>, and <italic>-A4</italic>, respectively (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As can be seen, each region configuration comprises a <italic>Mamu-A1</italic> gene characterized by high transcription levels (major) combined with one or two other <italic>Mamu-A</italic> genes characterized by lower transcription levels (minors). The <italic>Mamu-A1</italic> gene is probably responsible for executing the classical antigen presentation function (Evans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1999</xref>; Sidney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2000</xref>; Sette et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2005</xref>), whereas the others can be considered as nonclassicals and may interact, for instance, with the KIR gene family present on NK cells. Two complete MHC haplotypes in the rhesus macaque are sequenced (Daza-Vamenta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>; Kulski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>), and they represent two-region configurations. One haplotype contains the <italic>-A1/-A2</italic> combination, whereas in the other, the <italic>-A1/-A4</italic> pair is observed. Both region configurations are present in the animals of Indian origin (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of different <italic>Mamu-A</italic> region configurations observed in Indian rhesus macaques. The exact order and physical distances of the loci on the genome are still unknown. The relative levels of <italic>polymorphism</italic> and <italic>transcription</italic> of the loci are indicated. Two <italic>Mamu-A</italic> region configurations (1 and 5) are confirmed by the sequencing of the complete rhesus MHC region (Daza-Vamenta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>; Kulski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>)</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="251_2007_201_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>Within the present panel of 42 Chinese animals, 59 different full-length <italic>Mamu-A</italic> cDNAs were detected that can be grouped into various loci and lineages (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A complete listing of the alleles detected in the Chinese macaques is provided as electronic supplementary material (Table&#xA0;<xref ref-type="" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Because of codominant expression, rhesus macaques can be heterozygous for the <italic>Mamu-A1</italic> gene and thus can express up to two allotypes. Nine animals were found to express three different <italic>Mamu-A1</italic>-like sequences. These animals shared one of these sequences in separated clades in phylogenetic tree (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; <italic>-A5</italic>, <italic>-A6</italic>, and <italic>-A7</italic>). The triplets of the three animals are indicated by asterisks. The clustering of the three alleles, obtained from one animal, in clades distinct from <italic>-A2</italic>, <italic>-A3</italic>, and <italic>-A4</italic> indicates that one allele belongs to a separate locus. The newly detected loci are named <italic>Mamu-A5</italic>, <italic>-A6</italic>, <italic>and</italic><italic>-A7</italic>, according to the generally accepted nomenclature system (Klein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1990</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>; Ellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). Representatives of two loci, <italic>A5</italic> and <italic>A6</italic>, are also observed in cynomolgus macaques that express more than two <italic>A1</italic>-like sequences.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree of <italic>Mamu-A</italic> and <italic>Mafa-A</italic> gene/alleles detected in this study. The <italic>-A2</italic> locus is represented by four alleles only. The tree is based on full-length sequences, although analyses on only exon 2 and 3 showed no significant differences. The nomenclature of the new alleles is based on a more extended tree (not shown) containing all the <italic>Mamu-A</italic> and <italic>Mafa-A</italic> alleles now available. <italic>Asterisk</italic>, three alleles of animal Ri081, of which one represents the locus <italic>Mamu-A5</italic>. <italic>Double asterisks</italic>, three alleles of animal Ri145, of which one represents the locus <italic>Mamu-A6</italic>. <italic>Triple asterisks</italic>, three alleles of animal Ri078, of which one represents the locus <italic>Mamu-A7</italic></p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="251_2007_201_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
        <p>Thirty-three new <italic>Mamu-A1</italic> alleles were detected in the Chinese rhesus macaques. Although some of the alleles in this population group into lineages that are also present in Indian animals, sharing of alleles for the <italic>Mamu-A1</italic> locus is rare and was observed only once. The <italic>Mamu-A1*26</italic> allele is detected in both populations, whereas the <italic>Mamu-A1*03</italic> and for <italic>-A1*04</italic>, alleles are highly similar and differ for one synonymous basepair substitution. Hence, it is concluded that most allelic polymorphism observed for the <italic>Mamu-A1</italic> locus was probably generated after the rhesus macaque populations were separated. Sequence comparisons illustrated that most of the variations map at the contact residues of the peptide-binding site (data not shown). Thus, polymorphism at the highly divergent <italic>Mamu-A1</italic> locus, characterized by high expression levels, must have resulted from positive Darwinian selection (Hughes and Nei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1988</xref>; Borghans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>).</p>
        <p>The <italic>Mamu-A2</italic> gene displays differential haplotype distribution in the Indian population of rhesus macaques (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This also appears to be the case for Chinese animals, as <italic>Mamu-A2</italic> cDNAs were detected in 39 out of 42 of them. In this panel, 16 alleles that differ from the ones earlier detected in Indian animals were defined. In the Indian population, low expression levels characterize the <italic>Mamu-A2</italic> gene, which appears also to be the case in Chinese animals.</p>
        <p>Five Chinese macaques possess the <italic>Mamu-A3*1307</italic> sequence, which is always observed in combination with <italic>Mamu-A1*1102.</italic> In concordance with the Indian animals, the number of <italic>Mamu-A3</italic> clones detected also reflects low expression levels. A full-length <italic>Mamu-A4*1404</italic> cDNA was detected in only three animals. In contrast to the <italic>Mamu-A4</italic> allele in the Indian macaque, the Chinese allele has a stopcodon at the last triplet of exon 5 encoding the transmembrane part of the class I protein. This suggests that the corresponding gene product may settle in the membrane, but the signal transduction is impaired. As was observed earlier in Indian animals, this locus is characterized by extremely low expression levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For that reason, the presence of <italic>Mamu-A4</italic> cDNAs in the other animals was tested with SSP on the RT-PCR samples, and 17 out of 42 Chinese animals appeared to be positive for this locus. The <italic>Mamu-A5</italic>, <italic>-A6</italic>, and <italic>-A7</italic> genes are also characterized by low expression levels and are considered to represent minors.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the previously studied Indian population, the Chinese animals were selected randomly from a large population. Because of the lack of pedigree data and segregation profiles, it was not possible to firmly establish the segregation of different <italic>Mamu-A</italic> genes present per chromosome. Haplotypes can only be deduced based on sharing of sequences between animals, and such haplotypes are listed in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. At this stage, it is impossible to determine in which region configurations the <italic>Mamu-A5,</italic><italic>-A6</italic>, and <italic>-A7</italic> genes are present.

        <title><italic>Mafa-A</italic> region polymorphism and diversity in cynomolgus monkeys</title>
        <p>Sixty-two alleles were detected in the 96 cynomolgus macaques analyzed. As observed in the rhesus macaques, most animals had two polymorphic <italic>Mafa-A1</italic> sequences, in combination with orthologs of the <italic>Mamu-A2</italic>, <italic>-A3</italic>, <italic>-A4</italic>, <italic>-A5</italic>, and/or <italic>-A6</italic> genes. In total, 38 <italic>Mafa-A1</italic> alleles were detected, illustrating the high level of polymorphism of this locus. These alleles were compared with sequences reported earlier by two other research groups (Uda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>; Krebs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>) that have used different nomenclature systems. Only four alleles <italic>-A1*3101</italic>, <italic>-A1*3201</italic>, <italic>-A1*3801</italic>, and <italic>-A5*3001</italic> detected in our panel are identical to the earlier described sequences <italic>A*310101</italic>, <italic>A*320101</italic>, <italic>A*380101</italic>, and <italic>A*300101.</italic></p>
        <p>A total of 79 out of 96 animals have at least one <italic>Mafa-A2</italic> sequence, and 18 alleles could be distinguished (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The oligomorphic <italic>A2</italic> locus is also present in the pigtailed macaque (<italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>) as was recently described (Pratt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>; Lafont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). In these studies, 90% of the animals possess the gene, and lower transcription levels were also observed in comparison to the other <italic>Mane-A</italic> alleles. The <italic>Mafa-A3</italic> gene is observed in only two animals, whereas the <italic>Mafa-A4</italic> locus is detected in 41 individuals. Two <italic>Mafa-A4</italic> alleles were found that differ in only one basepair (nonsynonymous) substitution (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As in the Chinese rhesus macaques, the <italic>Mafa-A4</italic> alleles have a stopcodon at the end of exon 5. The <italic>Mafa-A5</italic> and <italic>-A6</italic> alleles were detected in, respectively, eight and four animals and display low levels of polymorphism. Phylogenetic analyses illustrate that apart from loci rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys also share lineages (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As found in rhesus macaques, the <italic>Mafa-A1</italic> alleles are characterized by high transcription levels, whereas the other loci display moderate or low expression levels.</p>
        <p>Because most of the cynomolgus macaques are pedigreed, the combination of sequences that are inherited on one chromosome could be defined. As an example, the kinship tree of one breeding group is provided (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The haplotypes are grouped based on the combination of loci (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Seven combinations of loci or region configurations are recognized (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and four of them (two to five) are also observed in the Indian rhesus macaques (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which indicates that they predate speciation. <italic>Mafa-A5*3001</italic> segregates in combination with <italic>Mafa-A1*6001</italic> and <italic>-A1*7201</italic> but not exclusively. The exact region configurations of <italic>Mafa-A6</italic> containing haplotypes are not yet known.

        <title>Sharing of <italic>-A1</italic> and <italic>-A2</italic> sequences between different macaque species</title>
        <p>A comparison of all available <italic>Mamu-A</italic> to <italic>Mafa-A</italic> sequences showed that six full-length cDNA transcripts are shared between both species of macaque. This is the case for five <italic>-A1</italic> pairs and one <italic>-A2</italic> pair (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). One of these cynomolgus monkey alleles is identical to an Indian rhesus allele, whereas the other five are shared with animals of Chinese origin. This observation was unexpected as the two rhesus macaque populations investigated share only one allele. The fact that cynomolgus macaques share more alleles with Chinese rhesus macaques than with Indian individuals may be explained by the fact that there is an overlap in the geographic areas inhabited by both species in Indochina (eastern Asia). It is known that rhesus macaques and cynomolgus monkeys can interbreed and produce offspring (Tosi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2002</xref>). Sharing of alleles was not observed for the minors controlled by the <italic>A3</italic>&#x2013;<italic>A7</italic> loci.

        <title>Different modes of selection operating on the <italic>Mhc</italic> class I and II genes in macaques</title>
        <p>Although <italic>Mamu-A</italic> and <italic>Mafa-A</italic> sequences are interspersed in the phylogenetic tree, the vast majority of the alleles are species unique, and for rhesus macaque, most of them appear to be population specific. This is in sharp contrast to the situation observed for the macaque class II region, where sharing for different exon 2 sequences at the <italic>Mhc-DR</italic>, but especially the <italic>-DQ</italic> and <italic>-DP</italic> genes, is far more common (Blancher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Doxiadis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). About half of the <italic>Mafa-DPB1</italic>, <italic>-DQA1</italic>, and <italic>-DQB1</italic> and one third of the <italic>Mafa-DRB</italic> sequences are identical to rhesus orthologs. As animals of the same populations have been used to study <italic>Mhc</italic> class I and II sequences, the present results exclude the possibility that this high sharing of <italic>Mhc</italic> class II sequences is because of introgression. A more likely explanation is that in macaques, the exon 2 sequences of the <italic>Mhc</italic> class II genes, which encode the peptide-binding site, have been subjected to purifying selection. As a consequence, many <italic>Mhc</italic> class II alleles in these two macaque species predate speciation processes. A databank search indicated that the phenomenon also extends to other macaque species (Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>The <italic>Mhc</italic> class I alleles in macaques are largely unique, illustrating that selection has favored diversity. <italic>Mhc</italic> class I proteins are involved in the presentation of intracellular pathogens such as viruses and parasites that are known to evolve at high mutation rates. Recognition of Mhc class I molecules combined with a foreign peptide may result in the lysis of an infected cell. The Mhc class II molecules select peptides, originating from extracellular pathogens such as bacteria and fungi, for binding. Mhc class II-mediated activation may result in antibody production and/or providing help to cytotoxic T cells. The present results illustrate that, probably because of coevolution with intracellular pathogens, macaques have generated a highly complex and divergent Mhc class I repertoire. The fact that <italic>Mhc</italic> class I alleles evolve quickly, even within a species, has been documented in humans for instance (Belich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1992</xref>; Watkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1992</xref>). The high degree of sharing of <italic>Mhc</italic> class II sequences seems to be unique for macaques and has not been observed in any other group of vertebrate species.</p>
